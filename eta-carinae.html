</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Post #4 and I'm diverging from the purported theme. But it's Eta
Carinae, it must be discussed!
Eta Carinae is the most amazing object in the sky, in my opinion. It has
been the most active nearby (around 2 kiloparsecs, or 6000 light-years,
distant - close only relative to, say, the Galactic Center or other
galaxies) object in the past few centuries. In 1840 it brightened by a
few magnitudes, and it has been discovered since then that this event
was a huge explosion.
But it wasn't a 'normal' explosion. Most exploding stars blow up and die
in supernovae. Those are awesome events that sometimes completely
annihilate a star and sometimes leave a black hole or neutron star
behind.
This explosion was nearly as powerful as a supernova, but the star is
still there. And it turns out that there are TWO stars there. There are
a number of different theories going around, but this system is
incredibly difficult to observe because there's just <em>so much</em> stuff
there.
The prevailing theory is that there are two stars, one around 80 solar
masses, the other around 20. Either one of these on its own would be
pretty big, hot, and impressive. Two together is something pretty
impressive - but actually not that uncommon.
Other pairs of hot, massive stars are observed frequently. One example
is WR 40, in which two 80 solar mass stars are orbiting one another. The
curious thing is that most of these massive stars have very circular
orbits, but in Eta Carinae the small star has a very eccentric orbit
around the large star.
One explanation for this - which is not widely accepted yet because it's
very hard to confirm, but it's plausible - is that Eta Carinae used to
be a nearly equal-mass binary system like WR40, but one of the stars
blew off its outer envelope (the outer part of the star) in a huge
explosion, and when it lost this mass its orbit changed. One bit of
evidence in favor of this hypothesis is that the small star has a very
fast wind - 3000 km/s, which is faster than any normal star's wind. Wolf
Rayet stars have winds that fast, though, and they are stars with
blown-off envelopes. It's going to take a lot of skilled observations to
confirm this, though.
Another neat thing is that the smaller star disappears on its closest
approach to the large star. Why? The large star is losing mass at a very
fast rate - about a Jupiter mass every year! That's more than a million
times as fast as the sun is losing its mass in the Solar Wind. All of
this mass loss has an interesting result - you can't see the star, you
only see the outside of its wind. But the small star passes inside the
'sphere' that is producing the wind, and so it's as though the small
star was going inside the large one! You don't see it at all during
closest approach.
I get excited about this star... I'd like to add a lot more on it, and
so you might see Luminous Blue Variables as a recurring theme on this
blog. I hope to post a lot of pictures and add some links to references
too.</p>
