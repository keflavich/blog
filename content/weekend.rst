What did I do this weekend?
-upgraded PyRAF from 1.6.1 to 1.7
-switched matplotlib backends from TkAgg to Qt4
-put up a new article on `molecularclouds`_
So... totally unproductive, but only in an awesome way?
I tried to switch PyRAF from X11 to Aqua a la `Ticket 86`_ on the PyRAF
trac site, but it failed with a can't-load error.
Also, updated `readcol`_ documentation so that it makes sense. Sam has
used it, Robbie might.
