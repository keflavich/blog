In preparing for an upcoming talk, I'm taking some notes on cluster formation
simulations, and I want to keep these notes available & public so others can
correct anything that's missing.  In particular, I want to note the resolution of
these simulations.


First, Jim Dale has several long series of papers on cluster formation simulations:
 * `Review Article <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015NewAR..68....1D>`_
 * `Ionization-induced star formation - IV. Triggering in bound clusters <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427.2852D>`_
 * `Ionization-induced star formation - V. Triggering in partially unbound clusters <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.431.1062D>`_

 * `Kim, Kim, Ostriker 2018 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180404664K>`_ ~240 Msun

Unfortunately, I stopped taking notes and started focusing on just the talk, so
this ended up quite incomplete.  I'm not going to try to archive this any further...

If you're interested, instead just see my talk: https://keflavich.github.io/talks/HighMassClusterFormation_TracingTheFlow2018.html
