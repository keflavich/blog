I've regularly had to calculate masses and column densities from CO
isotopologues, as have many others.  I found a textbooklike derivation in my
old notes, so I figured I'd publish them.

I don't have time to nicely format things now, but the code, associated figures,
and a 3-page tex document with equations are all here:

I'm pretty sure this all comes from a homework assignment in 2007 or 2008, so
it's likely there are errors.
