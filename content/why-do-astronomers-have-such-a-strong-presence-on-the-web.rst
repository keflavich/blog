I'm not making this a complete post, just a few examples of blogs and
websites I'm aware of. But we do have a strong presence on the web -
astronomers have an unusually high google ranking etc. Is it just
because 'we' were here first ('we' excludes me, I'm just jumping on the
bandwagon and getting a free ride)?
Examples:

`Dr Lisa`_
Science writers who write on astronomy:
`Dave Mosher`_
