There is a "gap" in the dust around Sgr B2

Sgr B2 is the most massive gas clump in our Galaxy.  It's about 100 pc away
from Sgr A*, the black hole at the center of the Galaxy.  It is forming stars
prodigiously, and has extreme properties in many regards.

In many physical aspects - mass, luminosity, velocity dispersion, temperature -
the Sgr B2 region is similar to "proto-cluster clumps" seen in other galaxies,
e.g. the Antennae galaxies.

There are plenty of mysteries about Sgr B2, including its extraordinarily
diverse chemistry and its peculiar kinematics.

I'm raising a sort of new one.  There appears to be a hole next to Sgr B2,
towards the southeast in Galactic coordinates.  It appears as a relatively
empty spot in the dust continuum bands.  It doesn't seem to be filled in
with anything in particular.
