1. `sptool`_ is a quick way to compare standards to stellar spectra.
Nice, I'd been looking for a tool like that.
2. `GNU screen captions`_ are useful especially when working in a
screen-within-a-screen environment (who does that, really?)
3. finally got `SPLAT`_ to work... turns out I just hadn't reduced my
damned data
4. `kill -STOP and kill -CONT`_ are really useful ways to pause programs
that are sucking up resources if you want to resume them later. Haven't
tried this on "real" code yet.
