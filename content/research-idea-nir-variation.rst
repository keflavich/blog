`I`_ really want to know how near-infrared absorption lines correlate
with emission lines; understanding this is essential for near infrared
calibration.

The emission lines correlate reasonably well, but not perfectly.  There
are models out there of how these should behave, but they seem to be
proprietary and non-free so I have no interest in them - I won't pay
before I know they work, and I can't test them.
But perhaps more careful measurements of the night sky lines could
provide some information about the absorption, particularly in the
Brackett-delta and Brackett-epsilon region we've been interested in
lately.
I'm pretty sure the change in slope observed above is from observing at
different airmasses (2.3 vs 1.05)
