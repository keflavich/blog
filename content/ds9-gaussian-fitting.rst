One thing DS9 desperately needs is an interactive gaussian fitter. I
have NOT implemented one yet, but it is high on my to do list. Has
anyone else (googlers?) tried or succeeded in implementing such a thing?
Ideally, something with NO dependencies: if I write one, it will require
python, numpy, and probably pyds9 - ick. Straight-up TCL would be very
much preferable.
