`I`_'m starting a blog on Molecular Clouds partly for the International
Year of Astronomy. Ideally, I'd like to present a tour of the W3/4/5
region, but at the moment that's more of a research blog than a public
blog. This is partly in response to `Pamela Gay's request for astronomy
blog feeds`_.
I've generally spent more time maintaining my personal web page than my
blog pages. The most interesting are:
`W5`_
`P Cygni`_
`Some pictures`_
but feel free to browse around.
