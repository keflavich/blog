First, the Guinness: I'm drinking a Guinness Extra Stout right now. I'm
a big fan of the normal Guinness Stout, but the extra stout is bitter -
bridging on skunky. I don't like it. It has a sour edge.
Last night, tried the Dogfish Head Midas Touch. It's interesting - lots
of flavors, topped by grape juice. It's a champagne-meade-beer. OK, but
not spectacular. Pretty drinkable.
Dogfish Head Santo Palo tonight. It's a brown ale that looks more like a
stout. I think it needs to mellow - it has an astringent alcohol flavor,
but depth once you get further in. It was a lot better when it poured
with some head than not. A little chocolate at the end, not much though.
Also tried the Avery "Ale to the Chief" Presidential Pale Ale. A little
like an IPA, but really a hoppy pale ale. Not bad, not my favorite.
Those Dogfish beers are too expensive. I ought to stick to Avery and
homebrews....
