<div class='post'>
People often make the mistake of putting " in place of `` in LaTeX documents. To repair this, the only easy solution is something like:<br />s/\(\s\)"/\1``/g<br />in VIM or sed.<br /><br />I've seen alternate solutions posted but they're all too complicated.  One recommendation was to switch to XeTeX, which sounds like overkill, and others all stated that a complicated perl script is required.  The latter is technically true, but why isn't such a thing readily available? <br /><br />Any other ideas?</div>
