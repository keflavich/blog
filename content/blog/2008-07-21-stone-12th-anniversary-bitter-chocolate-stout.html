Tried this 9.2% bomber last night, and even drinking it over the course of an hour and a half I could feel my nose not feeling afterwards.<br /><br />The pour was probably the most exciting part of this beer.  It came out an extremely dark, rich, thick motor-oil looking thing with nearly no head.  The flavor, though, is of a very bitter and very dry imperial stout.  I didn't get much of the chocolate tone, because I only taste chocolate when it is sweetened - bakers chocolate doesn't taste like chocolate to me.  I think this beer would have been better if kept a little bit sweeter, much unlike the other Imperial stouts I've tried lately.</div>
