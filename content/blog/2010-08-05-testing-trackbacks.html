I just want to see if "trackbacks" work at all.  I recently posted about <a href="http://buffalothedestroyer.blogspot.com/2010/07/histogram-in-google-spreadsheet.html"> histograms on google spreadsheets </a>.<br /><br />While I'm at it, might as well throw up a link to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/agpy/"> my google code site </a>.</div>
