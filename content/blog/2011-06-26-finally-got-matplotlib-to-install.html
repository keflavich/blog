<div class='post'>
the key is reading the readme, not just the make.osx file.<br /><br />These commands Just Work:<br /><code><br />make -f make.osx PYVERSION=2.6 PREFIX=/Users/adam/repos/mpl_dependencies/ fetch deps mpl_install_std<br />make -f make.osx PYVERSION=2.7 PREFIX=/Users/adam/repos/mpl_dependencies/ fetch deps mpl_install_std<br /></code><br />while, e.g., this one:<br /><code>make -f make.osx PYVERSION=2.6 PREFIX=/Users/adam/repos/mpl_dependencies/ fetch deps mpl_install </code><br />didn't.  I guess because that one doesn't actually install anything.</div>
