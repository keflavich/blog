Curiously, one of my wikimedia commons images has been included in this article: <a href="http://www.scienceinschool.org/2008/issue10/tamaradavis">http://www.scienceinschool.org/2008/issue10/tamaradavis</a>, though the image has little to do with the subject in question.  Noodle (can't remember her real name... that's sad on my part) is in the picture.  Neat!<br /><br />This might not be something to be proud of:<br /><a href="http://www.denverptc.org/denver.html">http://www.denverptc.org/denver.html<br /></a><br />GC was featured in:<br /><a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/000855.shtml">http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/000855.shtml</a></div>
