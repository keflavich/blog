<div class='post'>
One thing DS9 desperately needs is an interactive gaussian fitter.  I have NOT implemented one yet, but it is high on my to do list.  Has anyone else (googlers?) tried or succeeded in implementing such a thing?  Ideally, something with NO dependencies: if I write one, it will require python, numpy, and probably pyds9 - ick.  Straight-up TCL would be very much preferable.</div>
