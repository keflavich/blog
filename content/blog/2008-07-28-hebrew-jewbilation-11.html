Wow... 11 malts and 11 hops, and it tastes like at least 3 different types of beer.  There was an ale start and a porter finish to the first few sips, but later ones had a fuller, maltier flavor at the top of the mouth.  It has some Irish Stout smoothness too.  There's some residual porter-esque bitterness.  A lot of depth and complexity that keeps going.  Whew.</div>
