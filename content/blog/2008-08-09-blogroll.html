Since you're now subscribing (I'm assuming, at the moment and for the next... say... year, Kyle's the only one who will see this), here's a list of other blogs to check out:<br /><a href="http://sketchbrewing.blogspot.com/">http://sketchbrewing.blogspot.com/</a><br /><a href="http://thedrog.blogspot.com/">http://thedrog.blogspot.com/</a><br /><br />I'd send you to some other ones too, but they're not complete.  I have vague ambitions to write a genuine science blog for the international year of astronomy and public outreach.... but I don't really know if that will go anywhere.</div>
