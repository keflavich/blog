<div class='post'>
I should have posted these a while ago....<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/casaradio/"> casaradio </a> is a subversion repository for folks at <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu">The Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy at CU Boulder</a> to post radio astronomy related codes.  So far, emphasizes single dish (GBT, Arecibo), but will include EVLA, CARMA, and ALMA eventually.<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/aposoftware/">aposoftware</a> is a similar page, but is a mercurial repository and is meant to include instrument-specific software for the <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/"> Apache Point Observatory </a> <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/GeneralInfo_ARC35m.html"> 3.5m telescope</a>.  Right now includes a TUI script or two and the TSPEC and DIS IRAF-twodspec pipelines.<br /><br />I'd be remiss to leave out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bgpspipeline/">BGPS pipeline</a> even though it's mentioned on the previous post.<br /><br />Also, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/agpy/">agpy</a> is my personal code repository.</div>
