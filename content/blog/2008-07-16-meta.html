<div class='post'>
Why a blog?  I've been strongly opposed to blogs for the longest time (after all, Desert Strike coined the word BLOG as an acronym for building), so why use one now?<br /><br />1. link power - more links to my own pages if done correctly<br />2. google owns the blogger<br />2.a. google made it really easy<br />3. it's easier to add content here than to my real 'web page' which is already too content-heavy.  Still, my <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/index.htm">web page</a> is more useful for displaying code, my cv, etc.<br />4. needed a place to post beer reviews / brewing related content that doesn't fit on a normal web page unless I made a blog there<br />5. easiest way to take notes that I can't just accidentally delete...<br /><br />and now that I've made this post,<br />6. because I like metahumour</div>
