Neat trick I picked up from here:<br />http://www.ghostscript.com/~ghostgum/pdftips.htm<br /><br />Add this code:<br /><code><br />  \special{! /pdfmark <br />              [/View [/XYZ null null 1]  % unspecified x and y offset, 100% zoom<br />               /Page 1<br />               /PageMode /UseThumbs % /UseNone /UserOutlines /UseThumbs /FullScreen<br />              /DOCVIEW pdfmark <br />              }<br /></code><br />to a LaTeX document (probably near the top) and when you ps2pdf it, it will open the PDF with the thumbnail bar open.  This is very useful for proofreading after you latex a file.  Of course, xdvi also works well for this, but xdvi is VERY unstable on the Mac.  At least adobe, being a native Mac program, doesn't crash as often.</div>
