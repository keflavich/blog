<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3956">Public Perception of Astronomers</a>  <br /><br />While the article has some.... almost-interesting points, I don't agree with the thesis or the suggested methods.  I don't really have a problem with the stereotype of astronomers being the old, white, socially inept guy - because for the most part that's a fair assessment.  We're scientists, and at least for me and my peers, that's directly correlated with not fitting in to some social circles.  <br /><br />I agree that we should become better communicators in general, but it's silly to think that embracing new technologies (i.e. social networking tools) is going to change the public image of astronomers at all.  Personally I hope to see a backlash against social networking and blogs sometime in the next 5 years, but who knows.... after all, I'm writing a blog post.</div>
