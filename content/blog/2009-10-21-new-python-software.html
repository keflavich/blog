<a href="http://idlsave.sourceforge.net/"> IDLsave </a> was released on my birthday.  It does what you'd expect - read IDL save files into Python.<br /><a href="http://aplpy.sourceforge.net/"> APLpy </a>has a make_RGB_cube function now that takes care of all the internals of making an RGB image.... haven't tried it yet but I need to because it is awesome.</div>
