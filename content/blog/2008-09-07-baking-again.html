<div class='post'>
Since I totally ran out of food last night (ate my last frozen pizza), I decided it's time to try my hand at cooking things again.  That will start with making a bunch of dough, possibly shaping it, and freezing some, fridging some, etc.  Homemade pizza is way better.<br /><br />Need to get pine nuts.  'n stuff.</div>
