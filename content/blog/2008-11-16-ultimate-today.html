We went 2-1 in the tournament, losing the final in a windy game on universe point, 15-14.  We won the first game 13-5 or 13-6, and the second by a similarly wide margin.  I think I scored 15-20 points on the day and threw an additional few.  2-3 drops and 3-4 throwaways to balance that out.  Pretty good on the whole for what was probably my last ultimate of the season.<br /><br />Of course, that made me very exhausted for the review session this evening.  Oh well, I think it worked out.  I need to remember to come up with (and post!) a clear explanation of why you can use that silly little triangle to come up with the translation between angle on the sky and image size.</div>
