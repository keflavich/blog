Definitely the best movie in the past... 3 years?  IMAX didn't add much to the experience though.<br /><br />A little bit more: most people I've talked to about it (ummm... 2 grad students and 1 blog?) thought the movie was overhyped and didn't live up to the hype.  I liked it a lot, and I never saw a single preview.  Lesson?  Don't see previews.</div>
