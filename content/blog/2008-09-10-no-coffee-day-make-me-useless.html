<div class='post'>
I had a few productive hours after my run, then things kinda went downhill.... in the morning, I wrote two <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/ds9_imalign.htm">guides</a> and then taught someone else to use that stuff and then I tried to write up my lecture for tomorrow and totally failed.  I didn't accomplish anything after about 1 pm.  Lesson to me: don't ride no-coffee days at work.</div>
