wget is very useful for acquiring data from, e.g., IRSA, the NASA Infrared Science Archive.<br /><br /><code>wget -nd -r -l1 -A*g09*_b4_20.fits http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/IGA/images/</code><br /><br />The important elements:<br />-nd: don't reproduce the host directory structure<br />-r:  recursive.  Grab the files referred to by the page, not just the page itself<br />-l#: number of recursion levels<br />-A:  "accept" wildcard</div>
