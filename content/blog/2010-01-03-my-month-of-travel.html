I figure most people spending a month away from home would bring more than a small duffel full of clothes.  I was quite satisfied with what I had.  The things I missed (as a reminder for next time):<br />My desktop, eta<br />My music collection<br />Powerbars<br /><br />...nothin else, really</div>
