I'm not making this a complete post, just a few examples of blogs and websites I'm aware of.  But we do have a strong presence on the web - astronomers have an unusually high google ranking etc.  Is it just because 'we' were here first ('we' excludes me, I'm just jumping on the bandwagon and getting a free ride)?<br /><br />Examples:<br /><a href="http://www.starstryder.com/">Pamela Gay</a><br /><a href="http://dustchick.blogspot.com/">Dr Lisa</a><br /><br />Science writers who write on astronomy:<br /><a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/space_disco/">Dave Mosher</a></div>
