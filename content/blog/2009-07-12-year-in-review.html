<div class='post'>
It's been just over a year since I started this blog.  I posted a LOT more than I thought I would.  Also, I apparently dropped the tradition of reviewing beers.  So I'll start by reviewing some beers!<br /><br />Mountain Sun Hummingbird - a strong honey-ale (meade-beer?) brewed with orange blossom honey.  Slightly darker than a typical Belgian Golden but similar in style.  The beer is mildly sweet but very drinkable.  Hmm... there are flavors I should mention but they escape me.<br /><br />Mountain Sun/Avery Van Diemens - brewed with Tasmanian Pepper Berry, this is a very curious, semi-dark beer.  When I first sampled it, I tasted a little bit of pepper kick at the end, but couldn't really identify any other flavors.  Yesterday I sampled it next to a burrito with some somewhat spicy salsa.  Somehow, since my mouth was already sensitized to spiciness, the flavor I got was root beer (sassafras?).  It was... odd.  Pretty good, but I didn't end up purchasing a glass.<br /><br />Moving on to code.  I don't know why I haven't mentioned this, but with my discovery of svn, I started uploading my code to the webternets: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/agpy/">agpy</a> is my Google Code page and includes a number of useful python codes, especially <code>readcol</code> and <code>gaussfitter</code>, which I have tested and used extensively since writing them.  Python is still a long way from a cohesive astrolib code base, but with individual contributions, the STSCI development group, and APLpy underway, we're getting closer.</div>
