<a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/">I</a>'m starting a blog on Molecular Clouds partly for the International Year of Astronomy.  Ideally, I'd like to present a tour of the W3/4/5 region, but at the moment that's more of a research blog than a public blog.  This is partly in response to <a href="http://www.starstryder.com/2008/08/05/building-a-portal-to-the-universe/">Pamela Gay's request for astronomy blog feeds</a>.<br /><br />I've generally spent more time maintaining my personal web page than my blog pages.  The most interesting are:<br /><br /><a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/w5_public.htm">W5</a><br /><br /><a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/pcygni_public.htm">P Cygni</a><br /><br /><a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/astropix.htm">Some pictures</a><br /><br />but feel free to browse around.</div>
