1. <code> shopt -p </code><br />Maybe my hostname completion worked and then stopped working because the bash option hostcomplete was not set.  Duh!  Why?  I don't know.  Anyway, <code> shopt -s hostcomplete</code> solves the problem.<br /><br /><code> nocaseglob </code> is also pretty cool (case insensitive tab completion)<br /><br />2. it's really hard to search for readline stuff on google.  Can anyone explain to me how BASH readline works?  I would REALLY like to make bash readline work like ipython, in which you can start typing a command and hit the 'up' key to search through the history for anything beginning with the stuff you've typed up to that point.  But I can't even find documentation for the ipython readline!  Any hints, anyone?<br /><br />3. my desktop at work blocks ssh connections.  I can ssh into some computers and then into it, but not directly into it.<br /><br />...as usual, I made a list where not-a-list would have sufficed, and I had to add the last thing because a 2-item list is dumb.</div>
