<div class='post'>
I don't have a better place to post this one, so here it is:<br /><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/iras05358/figure-discussion/figures/iras05358_triple_17.29.png?attredirects=0">http://sites.google.com/site/iras05358/figure-discussion/figures/iras05358_triple_17.29.png?attredirects=0<br /></a><br /><br />My automated fitter (<a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/pygausscollapse.htm">Gaussfitting Cube Collapser</a>) has come a long way.  I now adaptively choose to fit 1, 2, or 3 Gaussian components to output to a data cube.  <br /><br />The purpose of that code is primarily to find a two-dimensional way to display information about the 3D structure, specifically about the presence/absence of outflows.  Outflows will inevitably be confused with multiple velocity components, but they are also likely to be convolved with them.</div>
