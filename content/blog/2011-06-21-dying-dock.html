<div class='post'>
My dock keeps dying.  Repeatedly.  Over and over.<br /><br />Only solution so far:<br /><code><br />ps -vax | grep -E "Dock|PID"<br />kill -HUP PID<br />kill -s SIGCHLD PID<br /></code><br /><br />And similarly for problems with Chrome + /usr/sbin/mDNSResponder.  They tend to go bad together.... no clues yet from the system logs.  Ironically, the crash reporter seems to fail the most often...</div>
