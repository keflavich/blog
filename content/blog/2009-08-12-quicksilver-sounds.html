To switch sound source from the command line:<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/switchaudio-osx/">switchaudio</a><br /><br />Use this to make scripts such as:<br /><code><br />#!/bin/bash<br />/Users/adam/humor/SwitchAudioSource -s "Built-in Line Output"<br />afplay /Users/adam/humor/losinghorn.wav<br />/Users/adam/humor/SwitchAudioSource -s "Built-in Output"<br /></code><br /><br />Then make triggers in Quicksilver by:<br /><ol><br /><li> Go to trigger pane, make new hotkey trigger<br /><li> press "." to allow you to type a command<br /><li> make sure the action is "Run"<br /><li> hook up a hotkey<br /><li> if it doesn't work, just try again.  Persist through crashes, they happen often.<br /></ol><br /><br /><br />Follow-up: You can also control the volume!<br />http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=585781<br /><code> osascript -e 'set volume output volume 100'</code></div>
