I realized I don't have a gardening category and I should.<br /><br />I have eaten 2 garden tomatoes.  There have been a total of 3 that ripened.  There is a fourth on the vine. There are ~40-50 big green ones being big and green.<br /><br />I ate basil in my pasta sauce yesterday.  I need to buy some pine nuts.  But I'm not pining for nuts.<br /><br />Next year, start growing in March!</div>
