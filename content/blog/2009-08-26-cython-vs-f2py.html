I had a go at optimizing some code this past week, and ended up learning to use both cython and f2py.  <br /><br />f2py is much easier to use.  If you want to write a function in fortran and use it in python, all you do is write the code and add specifications using comments in the fortran code.<br /><br />cython is more natural to code.  The code style is C/fortran-like: think in terms of loops instead of arrays.  The syntax is python-like, which makes coding somewhat clearer and simpler.<br /><br />For my code, I found that cython was ~10% slower than fortran.  <br /><br />Check out the plfits in:<br />http://code.google.com/p/agpy/source/browse/#svn/trunk/</div>
