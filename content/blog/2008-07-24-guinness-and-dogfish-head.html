First, the Guinness: I'm drinking a Guinness Extra Stout right now.  I'm a big fan of the normal Guinness Stout, but the extra stout is bitter - bridging on skunky.  I don't like it.  It has a sour edge.<br /><br />Last night, tried the Dogfish Head Midas Touch.  It's interesting - lots of flavors, topped by grape juice.  It's a champagne-meade-beer.  OK, but not spectacular.   Pretty drinkable.<br /><br />Dogfish Head Santo Palo tonight.  It's a brown ale that looks more like a stout.  I think it needs to mellow - it has an astringent alcohol flavor, but depth once you get further in.  It was a lot better when it poured with some head than not.  A little chocolate at the end, not much though.<br /><br />Also tried the Avery "Ale to the Chief" Presidential Pale Ale.  A little like an IPA, but really a hoppy pale ale.  Not bad, not my favorite.<br /><br />Those Dogfish beers are too expensive.  I ought to stick to Avery and homebrews....</div>
