<div class='post'>
I ate at <a href="http://www.fruitionrestaurant.com/cuisine.html">Fruition restaurant</a> last night with the family.  They serve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haute_cuisine">haute cuisine</a>.  I had the beef coulotte.  It was pretty tasty, but overall a bit too creamy for my taste.  The wine had a hint of cherry flavor to it.  The dinner was pretty good, but overall a little disappointing for the price.  The French press coffee was a bit much as I would have preferred a small cup of cappuccino.  I wouldn't object to going back when they switch to a new seasonal menu, but I'm not going out of my way.</div>
