Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday @ The Southern Sun: Delicious.  The Holler's Haze Smoked Porter is new on tap, and it's delicious.  Very smooth, the smoke is pretty subtle (i.e. not overpowering the way most porters are), and it's 6.4%.  <br /><br />Cleveland Brown is back on tap too.  It's not as good as I remember, but it will probably be better on nitro.<br /><br />Still no word on whether the Carne Asada burrito will return.</div>
