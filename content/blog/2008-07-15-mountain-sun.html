Went to the Mountain Sun, had the Thunderhead Stout and Stone's Levitation IPA.<br /><br />The Thunderhead Stout is one of my favorites.  It's rich, slightly sweet, full bodied.  I can't identify any particular flavors, but it's delicious.<br /><br />Stone's Levitation IPA is dark brown for an IPA.  It's hoppy and pretty tasty, but nowhere near as good as the Dogfish Head IPAs.</div>
