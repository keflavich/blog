Comedic timing has been fixed using quicksilver's command line execution abilities.<br /><br />Also been playing with dashboard... Safari's new dashboard feature is pretty cool, but also incompetent.  It refreshes every time you reload the dashboard, which is inefficient and makes saving settings impossible.  Also, the gmail compose feature fails miserably.  So, dashboard must die again.</div>
