Trying to get Apache server to run, and it's just a pain.<br /><br />I frequently forget how to update the locate database because it's different on macs.  Marcos' Mac Singularity <a href="http://macsingularity.org/2004/12/17/the-locate-database/"> has the instructions </a>.  <br /><br />In short:<br /><code>sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb</code></div>
