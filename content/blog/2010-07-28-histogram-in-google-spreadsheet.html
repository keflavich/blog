It's not easy to make a histogram in google spreadsheets without replicating data.  The "countif" function would be great, except it only allows very simple criteria.  However, there's a workaround:<br />=count(Filter('Grades'!V2:V30,'Grades'!V2:V30>0.9))<br />=count(Filter('Grades'!V2:V30,'Grades'!V2:V30<0.9,'Grades'!V2:V30>0.8))<br /><br />The Filter() function returns an array, which can be operated on like any other set of cells.  <br /><br />It's still not easy to make a nice-looking histogram, but the output of this process is at least usable.</div>
