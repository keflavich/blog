Delirium Tremens is a tasty beer itself, I think.  I'm drinking Delirium Nocturne right now.  It has a cool (opaque!) bottle, plus a pink elephant on the label.  At 8.5% it's pretty strong, but very drinkable with no taste of alcohol.  It's definitely my favorite Belgian brown now.  It still has that wheat-soy-sauce taste to it, but very weakly.  It poured with ridiculous head - I could not control it.  Overall, great beer, worth the ridiculous price I paid for it, whatever that was.</div>
