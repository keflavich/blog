I read a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4518">paper on ArXiv</a> today about SETI, and talked to <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~jdarling/">Jeremy Darling</a> about water masers.  This got me thinking:  the best way to signal your presence to the universe as an intelligent civilization is to take advantage of natural amplification.  So, say, you go find a big cloud of water molecules in the right state to start masing, and blast them with some of the right frequency radio emission: you get a strongly enhanced isotropic emitter.  Maybe SETI should look for those, then search for nearby coherent sources....<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Isotropic?  No.</div>
