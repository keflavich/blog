Stone Vertical Epic 8:  described as an overhopped Belgian, and I think they hit the mark exactly.  It was pleasant and drinkable, with a strong hop flavor but weak hop bitterness.   8.6% ABV<br /><br />Fort Collins brewery double chocolate stout: a reasonable dessert beer.  Not nearly as dry as Stone's Oatmeal Chocolate, but not as sweet as Young's double chocolate.  Chocolate undertones stayed undertones, which is not what I expect from a double chocolate stout.  8.1% ABV<br /><br />Avery / Liquor Mart 40th anniversary:  Just a hoppy ale, nothing special.  Had a stronger hop aftertaste than most, not up to Avery's standard.  No ABV label.<br /><br />Steamworks Kolsch: Very light kolsch.  I think it may have had a crisp flavor to it, but it was the last in line and unremarkable enough that my comments on it are untrustworthy.  4.86% ABV.<br /><br />Also, talked to Bobby again, he recommends St Bernard as a good Belgian.  That's on the list.</div>
