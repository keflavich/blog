<div class='post'>
What did I do this weekend?<br />-upgraded PyRAF from 1.6.1 to 1.7<br />-switched matplotlib backends from TkAgg to Qt4<br />-put up a new article on <a href="http://molecularclouds.blogspot.com">molecularclouds</a><br /><br /><br />So... totally unproductive, but only in an awesome way?<br /><br />I tried to switch PyRAF from X11 to Aqua a la <a href="http://astropy.scipy.org/astropy/pyraf/ticket/86">Ticket 86</a> on the PyRAF trac site, but it failed with a can't-load error.<br /><br />Also, updated <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/pyreadcol.htm">readcol</a> documentation so that it makes sense.  Sam has used it, Robbie might.</div>
