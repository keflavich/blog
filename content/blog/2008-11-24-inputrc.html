New unix stuff!<br /><br />This is, again, stuff I'd searched for forever but never found the right collection of terms.  This is what bash readline is REALLY all about.<br /><br />if you make an inputrc file, you can get awesome readline capabilities (similar to ipython).  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/command-line/ctrl%252Br-to-search-and-other-terminal-history-tricks-278888.php#c1887277"> This post at lifehacker </a> showed me how to do it.  <a href="http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/howlinuxworks/linux_hlkeyprogs.html"> This site </a> has a more complete description of how to use readline/inputrc.<br /><br />Even better: <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/bash-vi-editing-mode-cheat-sheet/">VI command line editing </a>.  <br /><br />There's also something called <a href="http://stackoverflow.org/wiki/Inputrc_for_bash_history_completion_using_up/down_arrows"> magic space</a> but I don't know what purpose it serves all the time... it will replace 'magic' characters like !* and !& and !! with whatever command they represent if you hit space immediately after typing them (explained better <a href="http://mike.hostetlerhome.com/2006/05/18/neat-bash-tricks/">here</a>).<br /><br />Wow.  Awesome.</div>
