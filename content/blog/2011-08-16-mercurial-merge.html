<div class='post'>
<a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/index.htm">AG</a><br /><br />My most hated behavior of mercurial:<br /><pre>searching for changes
<br />adding changesets
<br />adding manifests
<br />adding file changes
<br />added 1 changesets with 3 changes to 3 files (+1 heads)
<br />(run 'hg heads' to see heads, 'hg merge' to merge)
<br />remote: 1 changesets found
<br />running hook post-pull: hg up
<br />abort: crosses branches (merge branches or use --clean to discard changes)
<br />warning: post-pull hook exited with status 255
<br />$ hg merge
<br />abort: outstanding uncommitted changes (use 'hg status' to list changes)
<br />$ hg commit
<br />nothing changed
<br /></pre><br />Solution:<br /><code> hg merge --force </code><br />Hopefully there are other solutions that I'll eventually add to this.</div>
