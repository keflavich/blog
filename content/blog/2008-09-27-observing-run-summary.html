3 nights of worse than grade 4 weather (tau ~.4, i.e. the atmosphere is nearly opaque) have given me a few interesting results.<br /><br />1. Non-detections of CS 5-4 in a few bright BGPS cores.  My best guess is that the pointing was off, though, because I definitely got down to a noise level around 50mK.<br />2. Lots of CO 2-1 mapping, 13CO/C18O too.  That means I can now use this plot: <a href="http://dustem.astro.umd.edu/pdrt/co3221web.html">http://dustem.astro.umd.edu/pdrt/co3221web.html</a>  to try to measure the incident flux.<br />3. I can't do homework at the summit.  Maybe it's just that I can't do stellar structures homework, but I really am not processing this stuff well.  Damn.<br />4. Running at altitude uphill is really, really hard.  All the running I've been doing the past N months has not even come close to preparing me.  Need to correct that...<br />5. "I am inappropriate."  I probably violate a bunch of those rules... the important ones...<br />6. gotta get back to the mountains.  Really.  Seriously.  OMFG.<br />7. ARGH those papers need writing!  Lots of it!<br /><br />For the next observing run, need the following:<br />1. Pre-prepared A3 rasters<br />2. Larger selection of summit music <br />3. Better sleep schedule preparation<br />4. More caffeinated drinks per night<br />5. Cloud cannons.</div>
