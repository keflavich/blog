<div class='post'>
I want to print a multi-page postscript duplexed and, if possible, two per page.  pstopng, pstopdf, and the variants failed me horribly by making postscripts that don't fit the bounding box at all.  Any ideas?<br /><br />So far the best I've come up with is switching gnuplot's output to pdf, which is a workaround rather than a solution, but is useful nonetheless:<br /><code>set terminal pdf enhanced dashed</code></div>
