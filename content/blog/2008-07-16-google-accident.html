<div class='post'>
I'm still trying to figure out why google doesn't link to my page for the term <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/about.htm">died in a google accident</a>, but we'll see if this page ever changes that.  I link to <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/369/"> XKCD #369 </a> from that page with that phrase.</div>
