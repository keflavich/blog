Went to the pumphouse brewery last night and 'tasted' 4 beers.<br /><br />First, for a brewpub, it's pretty weird to serve tastes in single-sip servings, but that's what they did.  They didn't charge, so I didn't object, but it was difficult to get a strong sense for what the beers were meant to be.<br /><br />Beers:<br />Cherry Saison: light colored, mild cherry flavor, no sweetness or depth to match the cherry flavor<br />Ginger saison: strong ginger flavor, no depth or interesting beer flavor.  Like a dry but strong ginger ale<br />Saison: just... average<br />Copper: Weak flavored reddish beer</div>
