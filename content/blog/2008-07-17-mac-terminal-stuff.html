xterm-color has some annoying features when SSHing to other compys, including 'top' not functioning properly.  The error I receive:<br /><tt>top: no termcap entry for a `xterm-color' terminal</tt><br /><br />The solution:<br /><a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031031185759986">From MacOSXhints</a>, in bash just add <tt>export TERM="vt100"</tt> to your <tt>.profile</tt> file.</div>
