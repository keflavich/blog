<a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/iras05358.htm"> My Comps II paper on IRAS 05358+3543</a> was accepted by ApJ on Wednesday.  It will show up on arxiv in a few days and I'll post the link then.  Unfortunately, there were significant problems rendering the paper, so I recommend downloading my version.<br /><br />Also, working on the HISA KDA... <a href="http://eta.colorado.edu/cutouts/"> I have a nice section of cutouts </a></div>
