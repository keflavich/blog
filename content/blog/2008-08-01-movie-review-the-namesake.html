The Namesake was pretty damned boring.  The rich white girl might have been flaky and a touch rich-bitchy, but she was attractive, she loved him, and she did nothing wrong except perhaps out of ignorance.  Coming of age stories like this one are dumb and take away my respect for ultraconservative, traditional cultures.<br /><br />The one thing I can really say for the movie, though, is that it had awesome music.  Federico Aubele's Postales showed up at one point, and there was another techno/ambient style song I couldn't pin down.</div>
