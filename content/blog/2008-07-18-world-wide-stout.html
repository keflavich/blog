Last night, had ~4oz of <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Occasional_Rarities/World_Wide_Stout/17/index.htm">Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout</a>.  It was the Nov 2007 batch and was WAY too sweet.  Just like the <a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/irs/">Stone Russian Imperial Stout</a>, it was almost undrinkably sweet, so I recapped it and am going to "cellar" it (at 78 degrees, yikes) for a few months.  The Stone brew turned out a lot better on the second try, I hope the Dogfish Head does too.<br /><br />I also had a bottle of Young's Double Chocolate Stout.  Oddly, they don't have it on <a href="http://www.youngs.co.uk/">their website</a>.  It has a strong chocolate flavor at the start, but it fades quickly into a generic, strongly carbonated stout - it's nothing special after the first taste.</div>
