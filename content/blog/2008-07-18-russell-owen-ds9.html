As I might have expected, Russell Owen from the University of Washington - the man responsible for the Telescope User Interface, TUI, on the Apache Point Observatory telescope - has written up a <a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/owen/ds9andxpa.html">help page for XPA access points on ds9</a>.  He knows his stuff... I think I need to aspire to that.</div>
