<div class='post'>
Am I eligible for the NSF GRFP?  Sam says yes, I thought no, but re-reading.... umm... isn't this yes?<br /><br /><pre><br />Applicants must have completed no more than twelve (12) months of full-time graduate<br />study or its equivalent as of August 31, 2008. Full time graduate study is as defined by the<br />universities attended.<br /></pre><br /><br />No more than 12 months means 12 months is OK?  <br /><br />What was I thinking!?</div>
