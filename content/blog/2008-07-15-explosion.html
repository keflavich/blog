Our "Workie Ticket", which was doing its primary in the carboy, popped its top.  It made a mess but should still be healthy... the yeast was going extremely strong at the way-too-hot 78 degrees it's sitting at this morning.  It already has a fruity aroma, though, so it's likely that all of our brews are going to be extremely fruity.  Bleh.<br /><br />Our <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ginsbura/sketch_beers.htm">Honey Brown </a>, which was excellent at the start, has gotten a bit too dry and alcoholic.  The first few sips have a strong flavor of alcohol to them.  However, once you get into the beer, it gains a little bit of depth and isn't too bad... probably the alcohol talking.  I think most of the bottles are probably overcarbonated at this point, but we only have a few left.  Overall point: Honey beers need to be drunk within about a week of bottling for peak deliciousness; apparently honey dries out very strongly.</div>
