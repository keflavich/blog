Caffeine consumption stopped around mid-October.  I think it was when I got back from observing so October 20 give or take.  Re-started consumption mid-March.  Date is hard to say... I think it was Sunday before Spring Break, but hard to say because I still took it easy until ~last week.<br /><br />Conclusions?  I'm probably more tired in the mornings with caffeine than without.  Also, probably perform better @ ulty when I'm not addicted.  However.... not really conclusive.  Just addictive.</div>
