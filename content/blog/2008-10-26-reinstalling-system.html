<div class='post'>
Python died tonight when I foolishly tried to update numpy or matplotlib.  One was not compatible with the other in upgraded form, and the update for matplotlib wouldn't install because of GTK issues that were totally opaque.<br /><br />So, I reinstalled EVERYTHING - fink AND macports - from scratch.  If I don't get things running by morning I'm going to have to do a restore, which is ugly as death.<br /><br />Things I need to do post-install:<br /><code><br />        sudo port install python_select  <br />        sudo python_select python25<br /></code><br /><br />test ipython<br />test matplotlib<br />test numpy</div>
