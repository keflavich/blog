1. <a href="http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~mpecaut/sptool/"> sptool </a> is a quick way to compare standards to stellar spectra.  Nice, I'd been looking for a tool like that.<br />2. <a href="http://blog.bigsmoke.us/2008/12/04/gnu-screen-window-captions-as-xterm-tabs"> GNU screen captions </a> are useful especially when working in a screen-within-a-screen environment (who does that, really?)<br />3. finally got <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/splat/"> SPLAT </a> to work... turns out I just hadn't reduced my damned data<br />4. <a href="http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3607246/Fresh-From-the-Linux-Kill.htm"> kill -STOP and kill -CONT </a> are really useful ways to pause programs that are sucking up resources if you want to resume them later.  Haven't tried this on "real" code yet.</div>

So is SPLAT the much-wanted general spectral analysis tool we&#39;ve been complaining about?</div>
