<div class='post'>
Deschutes Black Butte XX - good for a porter, reasonably drinkable, but still a porter<br />Rogue Chocolate Stout - a bit bitterer than I want in a chocolate stout<br />Victory 12 - pretty good, tasted a bit like a trippel<br /><br />Sketch Wheat - much more drinkable than last time; "weirdness" gone</div>
