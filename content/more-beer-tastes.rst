Stone Vertical Epic 8: described as an overhopped Belgian, and I think
they hit the mark exactly. It was pleasant and drinkable, with a strong
hop flavor but weak hop bitterness. 8.6% ABV
Fort Collins brewery double chocolate stout: a reasonable dessert beer.
Not nearly as dry as Stone's Oatmeal Chocolate, but not as sweet as
Young's double chocolate. Chocolate undertones stayed undertones, which
is not what I expect from a double chocolate stout. 8.1% ABV
Avery / Liquor Mart 40th anniversary: Just a hoppy ale, nothing special.
Had a stronger hop aftertaste than most, not up to Avery's standard. No
ABV label.
Steamworks Kolsch: Very light kolsch. I think it may have had a crisp
flavor to it, but it was the last in line and unremarkable enough that
my comments on it are untrustworthy. 4.86% ABV.
Also, talked to Bobby again, he recommends St Bernard as a good Belgian.
That's on the list.
