Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday @ The Southern Sun: Delicious. The
Holler's Haze Smoked Porter is new on tap, and it's delicious. Very
smooth, the smoke is pretty subtle (i.e. not overpowering the way most
porters are), and it's 6.4%.
Cleveland Brown is back on tap too. It's not as good as I remember, but
it will probably be better on nitro.
Still no word on whether the Carne Asada burrito will return.
