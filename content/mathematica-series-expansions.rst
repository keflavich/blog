Mathematica & Series expansions

Mathematica does something stupid and incomprehensible (to me) with
their series expansions. For no clear reason, it makes the
O[x]\ :sup:`n` uneditable, and adds a bunch of formatting things that
prevent you from copying & pasting the expression and then solving for a
variable. Argh. While this is repairable using the "show expression"
tool (Shift-Apple-E), it's a pain and "show expression" is not meant to
be human readable.
