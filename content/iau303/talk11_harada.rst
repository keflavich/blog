Line survey in the southwest lobe of the CND
 * IRAM + APEX
 * RADEX LVG analysis
 * Assumed source size
    + density 10^5
    + grav unstable
 * column densities in many molecules

Physics affecting the chemistry
 * cosmic ray ionization rate
 * X-ray ionization
   + Less penetrating
 * UV photons
   + highly dependent on extinction
   + 10^4-10^5 G_0
 * Shocks
   + shock chemical models
   + gas & dust phase shock chem

Concl
 * High CR rates favored (zeta = 10^-14/s)
   + lower acceptable if UV included (zeta = 10^-15/s)

Questions
---------

 * Q: Ionization provides external pressure on clumps.
 * A: Would like to include in model...?

 * Q: Gamma ray ionization could do something.  Considered?
 * A: No, but cross-section is low.  Need lots of gamma rays.

 * Q Farhad: Age of molecular ring based on chemical model?
 * A: Assumed some age from CR turn-on, not age of CND

 * Q: More extreme CR ionization rate near Arches cluster, etc.  What is the
   best chemical approach for higher CR rate?
 * A: If CR rate too high, can't form molecules / will destroy molecules
