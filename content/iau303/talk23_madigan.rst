Central pc cluster
 * orbital parameters
 * disk of O/WR stars
   + distinct from S stars: circular-ish orbits
 * binary disruption formation of S-stars
   + hypervelocity ejected star
   + other star has eccentricity > 0.98
 * further stars?
   + "memory" of initial eccentricity "stored" at large radii
   + relaxation times increase
   + can't measure eccentricity directly because of long orbital timescales
 * Simulations of young stars orbiting
   + initial high eccentricity (disruption formation)
   + initial low eccentricity (disk formation)
 * Depending on the stellar mass, both origins are possible. 
   + lower masses better fit for disruption mechanism
 * IMF in disk
   + different formation mechanism would imply they should not be included in IMF measurements
 * start in eccentric, relax into circular
   + depends on density profile 
   + can infer density profile
 * "h-statistic"
   + angular momentum vector = Â±1 if circular orbit, 0 on plunging "orbit"
   + degeneracy between inclination and eccentricity
 * "special purpose" n-body code
   + high-mass stars consistent with disk
   + low-mass stars more like binary disruption
 * implies top-heavier IMF

Questions
---------
 * Q Cuadra: What tells you about the cuspiness?  Precession?
 * A: Yes.  Orbits closer to black hole have long precession scales.  Leads to
   more rapid change in eccentricity (and less precession).

 * Q: What is timescale for thermalization to eccentricity?
 * A: Depends on radius.  S-stars, already relaxed.  >0.02 pc, takes Myrs

 * Q Farhad: Radial profile of the S-cluster B-stars?
 * A: Haven't looked at that; similar to O and WR stars.  
 * A: R^-2?  Poisson limited.  R^-1.5?
