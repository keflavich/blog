VLA Survey
 * DnC at 24-36 GHz
 * Brick NH3
   + very high temperatures in brick: 100's of K
   + optically thin 4-4,5-5,7-7
   + brightest, densest clumps have lowest temperatures
   + 300K gas, but no SF

     - CR heating?
     - Shock heating?
 * 36 GHz methanol maser
   + shock excited
   + dozens of point sources
   + 75 candidates, 29 T_B > 1000K (masing)
 * why so many masers?
   + large-scale shocks?
   + 80 km/s velocity gradient across cloud
   + methanol & ammonia emission dominated by convergence point of velocities
 * class I methanol masers usually show SF

SF in the Brick?
 * 7 VLA continuum sources
   + peaks in a more distributed set of continuum emission
 * 25 GHz continuum
   + most continuum outside of the molecular gas
   + external ionization

Rest of the CMZ
 * Pistol & Quintuplet continuum with streaks from the nonthermal filaments     
   + second LBV seen in radio
 * NH3 near Sgr A*
   + NH3 traces edges of Sgr A East SNR
   + some SF in 50km/s cloud and 20km/s cloud
 * CND not in HC3N, weakly in ammonia
 * no NH3 or HC3N at brightest submm clump
 * nonthermal 3-3 line

Sgr B2
 * CH3OH only non-self-absorbed against hot core
   + shell structure
 * NH3 2-2 maser

Questions
---------
 * Q Walsh: NH3 3-3 maser.  Expected more of those.  Were there others?
 * A: yes, there are at least 2 others

 * Q: Temperatures of ammonia.  Is ammonia the only tracer that gives high
   temperature towards the Brick?
 * A: Yes, only one towards brick.  400-600K from H2 from Rodriguez-Fernandez.
   400K in Sgr A from NH3 too.  
 * Q: Formation pumping?
 * A: yes, possible.  Need to form on short timescales.

 * Q: Need hefty CR for that heating.  Can you expand on what VLA is good for?
 * A: CRs 10^-14, 10^-15.  May happen.  Hard to explain 100's K
 * A: VLA gets NH3 transitions for temperatures.  ALMA gives density.  VLA
   gives free-free. No overlap in frequency

 * Q: Is the brick a cloud?  Is this really a transient colliding flow?
 * A: I don't claim that it's bound.
