The Brick / Lima Bean
 * deep extinction feature
 * Tdust 20K
 * MALT90 gas gives different T than dust
   + HNCO usually traces 70K gas at n~10^6
   + 0.3 pc resolution

ALMA 13pt mosaic
 * 1.7", dv=3.5 km/s, 20 microJy/bm
 * column pdf is fairly lognormal
   + tiny excess on the tail
   + tail is only location of active SF
 * lognormal is predicted...
 * will form stars (already forming some)

Gallery of data
 * rgb slice movies
 * cold absorption filaments
   + huge aspect ratio & line width
   + only seen in HCO+
   + approximately perpendicular to polarization
   
Questions
---------
 * Q Mitch: Any qualtitative feel for the bulk velocity field?  Rotation, shear, compression?
 * A: Probably shear.

 * Q: Estimate mach number of shocks?
 * A: yes can but haven't yet.  
 * A Steve: M~70

 * Q: Column to volume densities.  What range?
 * A: 10^6 cm^-3 from the dust, up to 10^7
 * A: Only one transition of each molecule, haven't done local density estimates

 * Q Lang: Is the absorption filament a continuum feature?
 * A: Doesn't line up with anything in particular.  
 * A Betsy: There's a parallel filament.

 * Q Farhad:  What is happening at the one site of SF?
 * A: 80 blobs throughout the cloud, sizes ~0.3 pc, masses 10-100 msun.  1
   water maser with 85 msun.  No YSO correspondence
