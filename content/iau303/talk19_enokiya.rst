NANTEN2 CO survey
 * 12CO 1-0, 3' beam, 0.43 K
 * high latitude clouds with vlsr -200 to +150 km/s
   + 24um filaments traced by CO
 * Double Helix nebula (Morris, Uchida, Do 2006)
   + Torional alfven wave?
   + polarized lobe from radio arc?
   + CO detected
 * Other molecular columns tie back to Sgr A*
 * "Magnetic Tower" model
   + accretion around BH
   + CND creates B-field, spins it up vertically
   + 25 km/s outflow speed

Questions
---------
 * Q McClure-Griffiths: can you distinguish between magnetic and stellar wind models?
 * A: No,not really

 * Q Bally: Do you worry that the LSR velocities are close to local gas and
   spiral arms?  Could foreground confuse?  Linewidths consistent with CMZ?
 * A: Star-counting extinction distance estimate gives 8Â±2 kpc. 

 * Q: What evidence for jet?
 * A: no direct evidence.  

 * Q Farhad: Could it be infalling rather than outflowing?  Maybe hard to tell.
 * A: ...
