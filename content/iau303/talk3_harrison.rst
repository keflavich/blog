NuStar
 * Explorer class
 * PI-led
 * Will have guest investigator program
 * First focusing telescope in high-energy X-ray band
 * 100x improvement in 3-79 keV
 * Previous telescopes: detector was larger than collecting area of telescope
 * ~18" resolution, 12.5' fov

Our CMZ: Multicolor cmz vs INTEGRAL
 * NUstar FOV = Integral resolution
 * Survey Muno field (CMZ surey covering negative longitudes)

Sgr A*
 * Flares show it obviously
 * ~1hr/day
 * detection of flare at >10 keV

Gamma ray pulse in Galactic Center
 * enhanced X-ray emission
 * pulsations detected
 * 3.7 second pulsations
 * 3" distant magnetar: SGR J1745-29
 * Associated with disk of massive stars near Sgr A*?

HESS J1640-465
 * being observed right now
 * TeV source
 * possible evidence from NuStar for a pulsar

Nearby Starburst Galaxies
 * Observations coordinated with Chandra
 * NGC 253, Arp 299, M82, NGC 3310, NGC 3256
 * AGN may only be visible at high energies b/c of absorption at lower energies
 * sampling range in mass, sfr 

NGC 253
 * Lehmer et al 2013
 * Where is the nucleus?  Crowded core, hard to determine
 * Chandra obscured X-ray source "off-center" compared to Radio
 * dynamical center determined; Chandra sees one source near it
   + variability driven by that source
   + nustar spectrum by assuming all variability associated with it
   + classical ULX source: binary star + BH
   + Either IMBH or super-eddington accretion
 * nuclear emission overestimated due to ULXs

Arp 299
 * Only "B" nucleus visible at high X-ray energies
 * Only one nucleus currently active

Questions:

 * Farhad: Will Nu-Star look at gamma-ray bubble?
 * A: Two problems: 1. too extended, too much time, can't contribute much

 * Is there a possibility of other magnetars not yet detected?
 * A: Various types of magnetars.  Undetectable in quiescence.  Difficult to
   constrain overall population.
   Raises questions: unlikely by chance; do we not understand magnetar population

 * What is the diffuse emission detected with INTEGRAL?  In Sgr E?
 * A: We don't see hard x-ray emission coincident with INTEGRAL source.
   Centroid of INTEGRAL source offset from diffuse emission
