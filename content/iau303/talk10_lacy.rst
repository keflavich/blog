NeII 12um line

Observationally, little has changed.  Interpretation has changed a lot
 * Ne II and 6cm continuum look identical
 * data avilable from Irons et al erratum

Two models
 * elliptical orbit
 * spiral density wave
   + both assume same plane as CND
 * northern arm offset in PV diagram, but matched slope
   + similar in western arm
 * model assumes gas moving along ellipse
   + reality: probably moving at some angle to the ellipse
 * spiral model same as infalling streamer, something close to circle...
   + linear spiral
   + Eastern arm doesn't fit the model

Is there a physical explanation for a 1-arm spiral density wave?
 * 1-armed spiral is dominant instability in a keplerian disk
 * perturber needed: gas not self-gravitating, so can't be same as disk
   + B-field perturber?
 * dynamical model
   + orbits precess with power-law mass distribution
   + orbit crowding near apocenter -> spiral formation
   + 2e5 yrs to develop
     - persists for a long time: the precession timescale
   + fitting with Keplerian velocity is wrong
     - gas is seen at the apocenter of its elliptical orbit
 * inflow rate is small

[Exercise: reproduce his simulation & movie]

Questions
---------
 * Q: Clumps in CND interacting with each other?
 * A: Spiral density wave fails at 2pc from center.  Should not persist outside
   of 2pc, but accidental spirals should persist because there is no
   differential precession

 * Q Fred Lo: Trying to explain gas, that is not collisionless.
 * A: People here know how to do HD, MHD.
 * Q: Not a complete explanation.  What about western arm?
 * A: Maybe magnetically controlled structure?  Not in the same plane.
 * Q: Not a density wave in the Western arm

 * Q: What is the source of ionization?
 * A: Assumed massive stars.  But, too bright.  Maybe shock ionization?
