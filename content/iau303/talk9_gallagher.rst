Investigation to understand assumptions made in extragalactic obs

 * MW single example - what is unique, what general?
 * SNR / CR interaction model works in M82 & NGC 253, not in MW
 * MW SFR?  Is it right?
 * lots of nearby SAB moderately-barred spirals moderately analogous to MW
 * Maffei 2 
   + 5x10^7 msun mol gas in rotating core
 * NGC 253
   + 10^8 msun molecular gas
 * MW
   + 3-4x10^7

Similar molecular and stellar content

Major differences
 * MW: SFR 0.01 Msun/yr [my comment: this seems low?]
 * IC 342 & Maffei 2: 1 Msun/yr
 * NGC 253, M82: 3-8 msun/yr
   + nuclei don't follow CO vs SFR
 * NGC 253: huge wind (almost naked eye)
   + 10-100x MW CMZ thermal pressure
 * Gamma rays: MW overluminous at low energies?

Statement: "No correlation.  Extragalactic relation totally fails" on a plot with 5 data points...

 * not tied to CO
 * Must be a large range in SF efficiency
 * SFR not correlated with nuclear stellar mass
 * MW in SFR low-state

Episodic SF
 * Physical state varies
   + Chemical transition?
   + driven by chemistry rather than mass?
 * SF bimodal?  Need larger sample
 * Unexpected SMBH impacts?

Questions
---------
 * Q: Comment - SF adequate to explain energetics seen

 * Q Longmore: Idea for what's stopping SF in our own galaxy.  Rate limiting factor is that gas is not self-gravitating.
 * A: turbulent, yeah.

 * Q Mitch: Positive feedback.  SF starts, gets intensified.  Squeezed by external pressures.  
 * A: Agree

 * Q: SFR density of mol gas.  
 * A: Cloud production mechanism is different (rather than SF "relation" breaking down)

 * Q: Large range in star formation.  Is wind/outflow to SFR more constant?
 * A: would like to know.  Outflows not well-measured.
 * Q: Constant at what value?  
 * A: Outflow/SFR constant

 * Q Farhad: Dense gas in other galaxies?
 * A: Not known yet.  Need to know dense gas fractions
 * Q Farhad:  Need to know fraction of *dense* gas.   
 * A: Bigger debate in N253
