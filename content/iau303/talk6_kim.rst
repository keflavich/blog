Nuclear Rings

 * Form by resonant interactions with barred potentials
   + but bar torque is low near inner lindbland resonances
   + resonance is very long timescale
 * claim that bar strength controls bar substructure
 * bar potential modeled by "Ferrers Prolates"
 * Q_B is the "controlling parameter"
   + Q_B = 0.23 yields really cool looking models
 * stronger bar leads to smaller radius ring
   + pushes more gas inward
 * range of SFR
   + age gradient within nuclear rings
   
Two models of ring SF

 * popcorn model 
   + randomly distributed
   + no age gradient
 * pearls-on-a-string model 
   + SF at contact point 
   + age gradient
 * age gradient <-> lower SFR
 * simulation generating 10^5 msun clusters
 
Sim results
 
 * presence or absence of age gradient depends on SFR
   + no age gradient if SFR > 1 Myr
   + corresponds to maximum SFR at a contact point
 * prolonged SF requires prolonged feeding
   + HVCs (accretion of primordial gas)
   + ang mom dissipation by spiral arms
   + Galactic fountains
 * If corotation radius at large R, can feed spiral arms into ring

Questions
---------

 * Q: Sims are pure hydro.  Speculate on B-fields.  Chuckle.
 * A: Ring would be smaller

 * Q: Typical velocity of gas along bar in model?
 * A: 50-100 km/s

 * Q: Do you mean no need for x2 orbit?
 * A: no, need X2 to form ring.  Formation mechanism of ring is not related to resonance.
 * Q: Ring on x2 orbit?
 * A: yes

 * Q: is there observation evidence of age gradients in nuclear rings?
 * A: Yes, Mazzuca '08 shows gradient in H-alpha EQW

 * Q Farhad:  Can you form the circumnuclear disk (2pc) with the same mechanism?
 * A: Can't answer now.  Need to run the simulation with the right size-scale

 * Q: Would the bar be unstable to bending instabilities in 3D?
 * A: We ran 3D, and didn't see any difference.  But, with different initial
   conditions, may see dynamical difference..

 * Q: Have you modeled where the bar meets the arm?
 * A: No, couldn't do that, only treated stellar.
