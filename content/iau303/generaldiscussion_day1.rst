Large-scale:
------------

 
 * Q: incomprehensible.
 * A Kim: turbulent nuclear rings are found... if angular momentum large... ring
     can be very close to center

 * Q: Best guess for age of molecular torus in Herschel data?
 * A Kim: Simulations for external galaxies, didn't run for our Galaxy.

 * Q Morris: Asymmetry in distribution of molecular gas.  No asymmetry in
   stellar distribution.  Implies m=1 mode / asymmetry in CMZ.  Has the
   asymmetry been worked into models?
 * A Kim: ????

[ I can barely understand this discussion ]
 * Q: X1/X2; Kim sees mainly X2, but dust may be X1.  Does the ring form at transition?
 * A: No, rarely forms at transition radius.
 * Q: Weak bar case, lindlbad resonance is where x1/x2 change.  But with strong bar, 
   that approximation doesn't work.
 * A: Don't know if X2 orbits exist outside of inner lindblad resonance
 * Q: Dust lane on x1, ring on x2

 * Q: What is the filling factor of molecular gas in the inner region?
 * A Bally: 10%-30% very dense, with "soup" of low-density molecular gas.  H3+
   indicates ionized molecular gas present.
 * Q Which phase dominates?
 * A Bally: Megakelvin plasma must fill the volume (X-ray measurements), thermal free-free emission,
   plenty of ionized gas.  30-60% ionized gas filling factor
 * A Farhad: controversial what filling factor of mol gas is.  Oka, Geballe: 1%
 * A Geballe: 1% along *one* line of sight, towards Sgr A*
 * A John: Area filling factor is 1, volume filling factor is open question

 * Q Farhad: Twisted ring.  Problem with this idea.  Where is Sgr B2 w.r.t. X2 orbits?
 * A Bally: Sgr B2 is in the x2 orbit.  Not at apocenter yet, Sgr B2 not at
     tangent point, still moving out.
 * Q Crocker: Radius for ring?
 * A Bally: 140, 150 pc?  At least a degree
 * A Longmore: I'll show tomorrow inner ~100 pc

Smaller Scale
-------------

 * Q Longmore: What is the connection between the 100pc and 1pc ring?
 * A Ott: 20 km/s cloud is connected to the CND.  May be where molecular gas is exchanged
 * A Requen-Torres: John showed work from Rodriguez-Fernandez
 * A Bally: Streamers connected to CND.  Why's it called a disk?  It's a ring!

 * Q: What's the origin of the cirmnuclear disk?
 * A Bally: Matter that's losing angular momentum.  Dynamic friction, magnetic stresses, etc.
 * A Lacy: Suggestion of why gas drives into center....
 * A Kim: Collision between molecular clouds, B-fields too
 * A Morris: Room for controversy.  Transient feature because shear timescale
   is short, but the CND seems to be in some sort of dynamical equilibrium.  Is
   it long-lived, in which stabilities create clumps that are sheared out, or
   if this is just an infalling cloud that has recently circularized.
 * Requen-Torres: Inclination, two different areas (disks?) inclined to each other
 * Q Any evidence for ring evaporation?

[ most interesting point of the conference so far ]
 * Q: Gas dynamics in Galactic center complicated... creates bias related to BH
   mass.  How worried should we be about BH mass measurements using gas?
 * A Lacy: If we see gas preferentially at apocenter, we will underestimate BH mass
