Driving gas into Galactic centers
 * opposing torques at corotation point drives gas inward
 * observational evidence from nearby galaxies
 * barred galaxies have greater concentration (Sheth et al 2005)
 * observations of CO gas kinematics in M83, NGC 1097
   + FCRAO Quarry obs
 * ALMA concentration to M83 core...
   + high velocity gas near core
   + southern nucleus has spatially distinct outflow lobes

Questions
---------
 * Q Fred Lo: Can you distinguish between streamline convergence and cloud
   collisions?  Can you determine what happens when clouds collide?
 * A: Yes, with ALMA.  

 * Q Farhad: Physical conditions in NGC 253.  Temperature distribution?  All
   warm?
 * A: Our obs don't measure temperature. CO gives 50K on 10's of pc scales, so
   at least that temperature.

 * Q: Big bubbles in NGC 253.  Are there clusters near them?
 * A: Didn't find any in original data.
