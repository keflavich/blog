Many good talks today, but I was too tired to take complete notes.

Roman Shcherbakov and Alessandro Ballone
----------------------------------------
Models of the G2 cloud, particularly using CLOUDY.




Thaisa Storchi-Bergmann (Brasil): Feeding versus Feedback in Nearby AGNs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IFU views of central 100-ish pc in a number of normal spiral galaxies,
e.g. NGC 1068.  Outflow rates exceed infall rates: indicates mass-loading
in the outflow.


Mark Morris
-----------
Impressive images of the central few pc at 6cm. "Smoke Rings" indicating Sgr
A*'s outflow.

Jorge Cuadra
------------
Formation of G2-like clumps via WR wind collisions.  Most form far out, though?

Jerry Ostriker
--------------

Bondi solution inadequate: angular momentum
 * boundary conditions are a problem
 * self-similarity fails because bondi radius >> centrifugal radius
 * at low accretion rates, 1/250 of mass hits SMBH, most gets outflow'd
 * vast majority of time spent at tiny fraction of eddington...
 * Equatorial outflow of angular momentum

 * C Thaisa: observations include equatorial outflow
 * Q Fred Lo: Compare to what we see in CMZ?
 * A: Mark Morris's outflows fit the picture.  Equatorial outflow may not be
   generic.

 * Jets unimportant for galaxies, only important for IGM

Dan Marrone (USA): The Millimeter-Wavelength Polarization of Sgr A*
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Accretion flow causes polarization rotation of Sgr A* backlight
 * JCMT polarimeter first detection of linear poln
 * there is circular poln in Sgr A*

Joey Neilsen
------------
"fundamental plane" is correlation between BH mass, X-ray, and radio luminosity
 * Sgr A* fits it only in flare mode
