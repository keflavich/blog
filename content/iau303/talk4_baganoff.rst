High-res x-ray spectra of Sgr A* & surrounding emission
 * Radio pol obs: most accreting matter doesn't reach event horizon
 * 3 Ms exposure
 * specific roll-angles required because Chandra has no slit
 * detected 6.67 keV Helium-like Fe K-alpha
   + hi-res rules out 6.4 keV emission model

What mechanism drives Sgr A* flares?
 * what x-ray emission mechanism?  Thermal?  Compton? Synchro?   etc.
 * X-ray/NIR variable
 * mm/radio events weaker, longer timescale, optically thick
 * do mm/radio lead or lag?
 * What determines flare cycle?
 * What triggers flares?

Observations
 * Backgrounds are a big problem
 * Details about order sorting,  etc.


Questions

 * Farhad: Discovered a lot of X-ray binaries.  Find any sources within 1'?
 * Found the old recurrent ones.  Magnetar is new.  No new bright ones,
   searching for faint ones.  Vast population of faint variables.

 * Q: Underlying physical mechanism still unknown.  Where are we going?  How do
   we figure it out?
 * A: NuStar will help. Very narrow window; can't see optical or UV.   This campaign
   gives more examples.

 * Cornelia: Is anyone working on the diffuse?  Nonthermal filament sticks out brightly
 * Yes.  Sgr E & F sources.  Studying with NuStar team.  

 * Q: Can you create images with 3Ms spectra?
 * A: Not much better; the grating reduces raw sensitivity.  

 * Q: Dismissed possibility of periodicity.  Have you carefully looked?
   Lomb-Scargle?
 * A: Lots of times with no flaring obvious.  But, maybe a lot missed below the
   noise of the DC signal.  Brightest peaks are not periodic.  Peaks put into
   Lomb-Scargle, but not enough data for that.  Will look at power spectrum
   though.
