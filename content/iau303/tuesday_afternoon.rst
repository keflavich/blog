4:15-4:35 pm Tobias Fritz (Germany): Nuclear Cluster of the Milky Way (15 + 5 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Model fitting of nuclear cluster: Sersic, etc.
 * unusually bright nuclear cluster for its size

Globular cluster origin of nuclear cluster

Questions:
""""""""""


 * Q: Round component consistent with inspiraling globular cluster.  What about
   spectral properties?
 * A: No.  Metallicity difficult.

4:35-4:55 pm Tuan Do (Canada): Measuring the physical properties of the Milky Way Nuclear Star Cluster with 3D stellar kinematics (15 + 5 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Dynamics of CMZ stars
 * Massive black hole affects dynamics of a cluster
 * testing presence of cusps
   + old stars have no cusp
   + young stars have a cusp, but not dynamically relaxed
 * what is the true stellar density profile?  
   + can't determine by counting
   + kinematics can help
   + old stars randomly distributed
   + young stars concentrated
 * did the stats right
   + no binning
   + individual likelihoods
   + unfortunately, this is new
 * flat slope, no anisotropy
 * correlation between parameters, particularly the slope and BH mass
 * edge of core poorly constrained
 * infalling IMBH or SMBH destroys stellar cusp
   + observational constraints on IMBHs poor
 * QUESTION: Do the fits improve at all if you impose a GC distance?
   + Answered: Can merge with PDF from stellar orbits

Question
""""""""


 * Q: Inconsistent with 7.7 kpc distance to CMZ?
 * A: no, consistent within 1-sigma

 * Q: How do you contrain R_0 with this approach?
 * A: radial velocities give absolute scale.  Proper motions must also have
   some scale.  Match the scales to get R_0

 * Q: Don't use any information outside 0.5 parsecs.  Shouldn't you include it?
   I get the right mass if I do
 * A: Will help, but velocity dispersion dominated by nearest stars

 * Q: Anisotropy in cluster.  Get rid of red supergiants somehow?  Tangential
   or radial?
 * A: Hard to know.  Very little anisotropy.  

4:55-5:15 pm Mark Wardle (Australia): Star Formation within 0.5 pc of SgrA* (15 + 5 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Highest I've ever been for a talk"

High densities needed to overcome tidal shear
 * big cloud -> Hoyle-Littleton accretion
   + self-intersecting orbit on the backside of the cloud
 * central hole because accreted?
 * high magnetic pressure in disk: 10x greater than gas
 * B-fields suppress fragmentation
 * Black hole takes bite out of cloud
 * optically thick disk: sigma T_eff^4 cooling
   + heating due to starlight, accretion
 * twisting knobs to figure out where accretion disk turns into fragmenting disk
   + inside, magnetically active / supported
   + outside (0.04 pc) fragmenting
   + further out: grav stable
 * maybe high accretion rate drove fermi bubble
 * accretion rate consistent with 10^6 Msun/Gyr -> build Sgr A*

Questions
"""""""""


 * Q Mitch: Grav unstable region globally unstable?
 * A: Has to do with the disk height.  h/r very small, not an issue

 * Q Fred Lo: We don't see any of this observationally.  All history?
 * A: Yes, this all happened a few Myr ago.

 * Q: Eddington accretion: what happens to rest of star formation and the disk?
 * A: I think it's OK - star formation 10^4-10^5 years, but dump time 10^5-10^6 yrs

 * Q: Bonnel & Rice did simulations.  Why need more?
 * A: B-fields?  Eqn of state?  Radiative cooling?  Crazy enough initial conditions?
 * A Farhad: didn't include radial distribution of stars

 * Q: How do you start with 0-angular-momentum cloud?
 * A: Lots of junk around, maybe collisions do it.  I don't have a good answer.
   Depends on how big a fluffy cloud you use.

 * Q Fred Lo: What observational signature remains?
 * A: Maybe kinematics

5:15-5:35 pm Andrea Ghez (USA): Probing General Relativity with Short Period Stars at the Galactic Center (15 + 5 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Why continue studies of GC stars?
 * Test GR
 * Role of BH in galaxies
 * Depth of potential 100x greater, on mass scale 10^6 larger than other tests
 * simplest tests
   + Relativistic redshift (easy)
   + Precession of periapse
 * SO-2 "star of the show"
   + next close approach in 2018.5
   + relativistic signal ~200 km/s
   + need very accurate keplerian orbit first
   + radial velocity from BrG
 * absolute reference frame is tough
   + masers give the reference frame, but require larger field
 * full orbital coverage with astrometry
   + 13-parameter model
 * Systematic drift in reference frame
   + There is a major source of systematic error  
   + Spatial variation in PSF (AO issue) is the worst systematic     
   + drift term prevents bias
   + 5 km/s uncertainty projected by 2018

     - 5-sigma GR detection
 * GEMS to make reference frame
 * TMT could do 2-yr orbits

Questions
"""""""""


 * Q Ostriker: Could the SMBH be sloshing?  Can you allow for that?  What about acceleration?
 * A: Mark Reid did calculation.  Limit ~3 km/s for present BH velocity.
   Problem: assume linear velocities, but that is not always a safe assumption.
   If BH accelerating, would create "nonphysical" accelerations.
 * Q: Many things spiral into center, will lead to oscillations in BH motion

 * Q Stocke: How big an effect is blending with unseen stars?
 * A: We simulate it. But, trying to simulate something we don't understand.  <0.1 mas

 * Q: Contributions from resonant relaxation, encounters with other stars.
 * A: Skipped the slide that shows this.  For GR, insignificant, but for
   precession of periapse, have to worry.
 * Q: What about the velocity component?
 * A: small effect on velocity.

Discussion Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



 * Q: IMFs shallower than salpeter.
 * A Lu: Hard to decouple from dynamical history.  push on spectroscopy to
   lower masses.  Decouple young and old populations
 * A Fritz: instrument sensitivity limit... VLT can detect CO bandheads...?
 * How well do we know it's 2 populations, or maybe it's just 1 population?
   Assumptions disagree, not measurements
 * Stocke: Background is changing in center.  Can you use fluctuation analysis
   to determine brightness of lower mass stars?
 * Lu: Very challenging for young stars because they're a small fraction of the
   total luminosity.   Foal(?) et al did good work on older star populations

 * Arches cluster: Hui Dong found 4 runaways of same mass as the 12 stars in
   the Arches cluster.  Maybe as many runaways as cluster stars?  Half of
   cluster stars kicked out.  Do dynamical models predict this?
 * [silence]
 * Find massive stars in "other 3/4" (I'm lost...). Need spectroscopy
 * Ghez: Role of binary stars in ejections.
 * Missing half of cluster mass?
 * Ghez: Role of interaction with black hole?  Clusters not evolving in isolation
 * Arches 2.5 Myr old.  Largest stars could just start... evolving? 
 * Most difficult objects to explain are LBVs.  LBVs outside of cores of
   clusters.  How do you get very massive binaries out of cores?  
   All LBVs found are outside cores.

 * Role of binaries.  New evolutionary models.  LBVs that must be <2 Myr, WCs
   must be >4 Myr.  Contradiction?
 * New evolutionary models say many stars come from rejuvenation.  Massive blue
   stragglers.

 * In situ formation?  What fraction should be expected to be formed in situ?

 * How confident are we about mass-luminosity relation for stars?
 * Lu: On main sequence, confident, but post-main-sequence is uncertain.  We
   drop them in our analysis.  Pre-main sequence is a problem in Arches.
   Arches fitted with only main-sequence stars
 * very difficult with rotation included

 * Distance to the Galactic center "decreasing at an alarming rate".  Does determination
   conflict with any other indicators?  What does that mean?
 * Ghez: Mark Reid likes lower R_0.  All consistent within uncertainties

 * Do simulations for S stars include interactions between stars?
 * Ghez: Not in most recent version, but in an earlier version

 * How does this test of GR compare with other tests of GR around Sgr A*?
 * Ghez: Event Horizon Telescope, GRAVITY.
 * Different systematics.

 * Are HST data consistent with BH at center?
 * Tuan Do: Same reference frame.  BH defined to be at center.  Velocity can
   drift, but not position
