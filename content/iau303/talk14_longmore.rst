Is SF different in disk?
 * 5-10% of gas in CMZ
 * 5-10% of SF in CMZ
 * Density in CMZ 2 orders of magnitude higher

Suppressing Mechanisms in the CMZ
 * Stars dominate grav potential
   + outside "ring", gas is not self-gravitating
   + Within 100 pc, gas is self-grav
 * Local suppression dominated by turbulence by orders of magnitude
 * Dense gas PDF from Kritsuk
   + dispersion set by Mach number 
 * Threshold for SF in CMZ very high: ~10^8 cm^-3

Turbulence
 * dissipates in a crossing time
   + what drives it?
   + MRI, GI, outflows, Sne all orders of magnitude too low
   + steady-state gas inflow also too small
 * "acoustic instabilities" large enough
   + outside inner lindblad resonance, spiral waves driven by grav instabilities
 * `Montenegro, Yuan, Elmegreen 1999 model <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...520..592M>`_
   + gas falling into stellar potential
   + "acoustic instability"

Quiescent vs Starburst phase     
 * "simple idea"

CMZ in Cosmological Context
 * velocity dispersion vs density?
   + high redshift clouds and CMZ clouds occupy same parameter space
 * "CMZ is inditinguishable from high-redshift starburst"    

Details of stellar mass assembly
 * Molinari Ring picture: 2 vertical oscillations per orbit
 * map mass density along orbit
 * gas compressed at pericenter
 * PPV structure extraction...
   + orbital fitting
   + can't fit Molinari ring
   + closed orbits not possible: precession
   + can't fit P-V wiggle
   + doesn't fit Sgr B2
 * Pericenter passage SPH sim
   + VERTICAL compression
   + retrograde, counterrotating gas due to shear
 * dense gas fraction vs orbit...
   + prediction of density vs orbital position
   + Plug for Ginsburg et al VLA/GBT H2CO densitometry
 * IMF variation interesting future avenue

Questions
---------
 * Q: On pc scales, fits with Ken-Schmidt relation
 * A: Depends on geometry.  Donut vs pancake geometry.
 * Q: Isn't there gas that is more efficient at forming stars?
 * A: Doesn't fit...

 * Q: KS relation doesn't work for CMZs in other galaxies.  How did you measure
   dispersion for high-Z clouds?
 * A: Some high-z clouds with direct measurements.  Otherwise, assume virial
   equilibrium.  Robust no matter how you derive it.  
 * Q: Struggling in nearby galaxies, particularly because of outflows.
 * A: best we can do

 * Q: CMZ is similar to high-z objects.  GC in pre-starburst phase.  So we
   should have a starburst soon.
 * A: Either gas won't form stars, or will do so in bursty fashion

 * Q: Predicts lots of very dense gas in Galactic center, n~10^8.
 * A: See Jill's talk.

 * Q Wardle: Turbulence damps on vertical crossing time (0.5 Myr).  20km/s
   linewidth disappear in 0.5 Myr?  Do you see dead clouds?  Don't travel very far,
   so should damp.
 * A: [should have answered: it's driven!]
