Data from many sources
 * IRAM, APEX, Herschel
 * SOFIA now: FORCAST & GREAT

CO SED
 * Measure up to CO 21-20
 * Model with LVG
 * Needs multiple components

   + but no high-density components
 
HNC/HCO+
 * Mills et al, 2013... on arxiv tomorrow
 * Vibrationally excited H3CN
 * RADEX -> n~10^5.3-6.5
 * most of CND not tidally stable
 * High temperatures (120-150K) required to excite vibrationally excited gas

Many works indicate CND not stable
 * [Lacy indicated: doesn't need to be gravitationally stable; is formed by shear]
 * Betsy proposing HCN ladder with ALMA

Questions
---------

 * Q: If densities below Roche densities, maybe clumps are not virialized but
   they contain virialized cores.
 * A: In very close...
 * Q: Model - black hole compresses clumps when they get closer to BH
