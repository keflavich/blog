CND
 * clumpy, but how clumpy?
 * self-gravitating, n~10^8?
 * examine small-scale structures in CND
   + clump-size power spectrum

Method description
 * noisy image: difficult to fit
 * smoothing bad: spectral resolution varies across OSIRIS field
   + really, really ugly spectral resolution map
 * Smoothing "during fitting"
 * GOAL: maps of velocity, width, density
   + similar to deconvolution
