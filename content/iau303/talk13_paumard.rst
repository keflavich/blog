CND
 * clumpy, but how clumpy?
 * self-gravitating, n~10^8?
 * examine small-scale structures in CND
   + clump-size power spectrum

Method description
 * noisy image: difficult to fit
 * smoothing bad: spectral resolution varies across OSIRIS field
   + really, really ugly spectral resolution map
 * Smoothing "during fitting"
 * GOAL: maps of velocity, width, density
   + similar to deconvolution
 * decomposed into linewidth, centroid, and amplitude
   + High, narrow peaks

Result
 * HII / H2 decorrelated
   + BrG traces low-H2 regions
 * thin filaments with narrow line widths

Questions
---------

 * Q Farhad: Any asymmetric velocity profiles towards positions, i.e. outflow signatures?
 * A: No asymmetry noted.

 * Q: How unique is the solution?
 * A: If S/N good, fairly unique
