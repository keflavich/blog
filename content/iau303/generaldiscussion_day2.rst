Farhad discussion points:
 * Fraction of dense molecular gas in CMZ?
 * Volume filling factor of dense gas?
 * Abundances in CMZ?
 * Lada 2012 plot: SFR vs Molecular Gas Mass.  Density is crucial

   + Steve: Not volume, column density.  Assumptions about 3rd dimension.  All
     gas above Lada's column density threshold.
   + Gallagher: exgal community correlates surface density with SFR.
     Variations on local scales

 * Aalto: HCN as dense gas tracer in ULIRGs - problem.
 * Steve: comparison to centers of other galaxies... rings have low volume
   filling factor, not pancakes but rings

   + unlikely that column density uniformly distributed along line of sight;
     likely to be clumped
 * Bally: comment on face-on views.  Mostly filaments.  Filaments tend to be
   end-on on positive side, face-on on negative side.  Could Brick be an end-on
   filament?
   + Gallagher: +1
 * Mills: ALMA data can answer that with excitation.  NH3 thought of as
   high-density tracer, but not in CMZ.
   + plug by me
 * Juergen Ott: Interferometer and single-dish, 10% filling factor
 * Gallagher: Density limit on SF from star clusters.  10^6-ish, high SFE.
   Star clusters may imply upper bound
 * Farhad: Mass of molecular clouds from dust emission.  Mass of low and high
   density gas
   + Rathborne: Opacity, chemistry very tough
 * Aalto: "Medusa merger" large-scale, very high efficiency.  Timescales are a
   problem: no high-density gas tracers seen, but plenty of star formation is
   seen
 * Mills: How do you trace this highest density gas, then?
   + Aalto: H2CO, Ao et al.  Weak chemical variation.
   + Rathborne: "Million dollar question".  H2CS follows continuum better than other tracers
 * Dust normally considered better tracer of mass.  Do we really know dust to
   gas ratio?   Factor of 2 at best
 * Farhad: Question raised yesterday... asymmetry of SFR/mass
   How do we explain distribution

   + Steve: How measure SFR?
   + Farhad: YSOs counting
   + Bally: You sure they're YSOs?
   + Farhad: Yes, best we can do, age ~few 10^5 yrs.  Maybe YSOs obscured?  If
     not, interesting issues
   + Steve: Could YSOs have moved after they formed?  Dynamical time...
 * What's the extinciton at 24um?  Selection effect?
   + Farhad: Could be selection.  Sgr B2 makes things worst.
   + Not clear 24um sources come from same volume
 * Dust is the best measure for mass.  Only free parameter is temperature.  KS
   not very fundamental.
