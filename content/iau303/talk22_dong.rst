HST/NICMOS PaA GC survey
 * Color-based stellar classification
   + WN,WC stars
 * Isolated WN stars
   + ejected from clusters
 * spectroscopy of 8 "isolated" stars
   + LOS velocity to determine memberships...
 * new Of I star

Questions
---------
 * Q: Mass segregation?  Do you expect such a large number of stars kicked out?
 * A: Yes.  High density of massive stars in cores, 3-body interaction common there
 * Q: NIII and HeII lines?  Stellar wind effects move the centroid

 * Q: Radial velocities are isolated stars on one side of Arches cluster.  Is
   that expected?  
 * A: I don't know if we expect that.

 * Q: What stellar masses of escaped stars?
 * A: Not measured yet.
 * A Cornelia: many are radio-continuum detected.  Consistent with stellar wind predictions
 
 * Q Farhad: Star formation rate from runaways?
 * A: Half of the stars come from clusters.  Double the SFR from the clusters.  0.05 Msun/yr

 * Q Mark Pound (?): Orbital histories.  Are any of the orbits more likely than the others?
 * A: Some could have been members.
