Physical conditions & chemistry

Astrochemistry as a diagnostic...
 * 50+ molecules detected exgalactically
 * CO n>10^2, HCN n>10^4
 * temperature NH3, H2CO
 * Only works if molecules excited by collisions
 * 12CO/13CO increases towards GC because more diffuse gas [my q: integrated?]

"Raisin Roll" view:
 * Mol massin dense clumps, HI diffuse throughout
 * HCO+, H3O+, HNC, HC3N, CN, SiO, H2O

General Trends
 * HNC 1-0 anticorrelated with HCN+ 1-0
 * C2H ubiquitous

"Hot Cores"
 * Arp 220
 * Drive outflows
 * "Boring" NGC 1377 (optically) 
   + has very deep SiO absorption
   + molecular outflow M~10^7 Msun
   + 860um optically thick core
 * NGC 4418 "Ugly Duckling" galaxy
   + optically thick "atmosphere" dust core surrounded by molecular disk
   + N~10^25 cm^-2
   + inner temp ~200-300K
   + molecular "disk" ~50K
 * unclear how common optically thick cores are
   + can be studied with vibrationally excited molecules
 * NGC 4418
   + Global spectrum dominated by vibrationally excited HC3N
 * Mrk231 
   + HCN outflow, 1000 km/s
   + vibrationally excited HCN in core
 * vibrationally excited lines trace warped disk
 * Arp 220W: amplified IR-pumped HNC

ALMA NGC 4418 "spectral scan"
 * dominated by vibrational lines

SMA spectral scanning in Arp 220
 * problematic: wide lines
 * vibrational lines are the new standard

Less obscured galaxies
 * NGC 253, IC 342, Maffei 2, NGC 1068...
 * same chemistry can trace outflows or star formation
 * HNC, HCN, HCO+ correlated with 3mm continuum: trace SF
 * HNCO, CH3OH, SiO anti-correlated with SF: probably trace outflows
 * N2H+ - "warm gas" and "warm dust".  Not the same in our galaxy & others

NGC 1068 
 * PdBI Spirals around center
 * ALMA bar + spirals
   + central cirumnuclear disk
 * complicated chemistry towards true center 
 * noncircular motions

More results:
 * ALMA + ATCA towards Cen A
 * NGC 1097
 * HC3N in Mrk 231
 * HCN in wind... extreme hcn abundance


Questions:


 * Inner NGC 1068 ring - what resolution can you get with ALMA?  Can you see kinematics?
 * A: Yes, can see kinematics.  0.1", can do ~10x better eventually.  400 km/s


 * Draw attention to MOPRA MALT-90: good comparison survey for galaxies
 * Thanks
