TeV observations
 * scintillation in air (Cherenkov)
 * Hadron detection
 * watching for light showers
 * HESS camera is huge: 1.5m across (fast photometers)
 * HESS, VERITAS, MAGIC dominate

Galactic Center
 * high energy density (100 eV cm^-3)
 * dense GMCs & starburst activity
 * HESS CMZ good...
 * VERITAS CMZ 18-sigma in 46h
 * HESS, mol clds trace similar areas
 * Local excess of 10 TeV -> requires local source of CRs
 * Correlation between mol clds great in Sgr B, Sgr A, but poor in Sgr D
   + no TeV emission at \|l|>1 degree
   + Propagation from central source? not enough propagation time
   + Maybe CRs directly accelerated?

Central Source
 * Could be Sgr A*, Sgr A East SNR, or other
 * best fit position is 6"rms around Sgr A*
   + Sgr A East ruled out with CCD-guiding based observations
 * No variability detected
 * in general, only middle part of SED variable
 * Pulsar Wind Nebula ruled out with Chandra?

Dark Matter search
 * exclude central region with diffuse CR-driven emission
 * search at \|b|>0.5
 * no positive detection; see Friday talks

Testing SFR
 * TeV detections of M82 (Veritas), NGC 253 (HESS)
 * NGC 253 approximately pointlike
   + 0.5% crab
   + Linear from gamma ray to TeV
   + hard spectrum
   + 3 orders of magnitude more luminous than CMZ
   + 2x10^38 vs 10^35
 * M82 VERITAS
   + 0.9% crab
   + more luminous: 2x10^39 ergs
 * Why brighter?
   + Higher B-field?  Higher CR density?
 * Starburst could be calorimetric; Sgr A cannot be
   + [Unclear - does that mean CRs escape in the Galaxy?]

HESS II
 * bigger telescopes
 * lower energy threshold
 * better res & sens
 * 10m+ optical dish

Sgr A* with HESS II
 * 3 hrs so far...
 * lines up with Fermi spectrum


Questions
 * Can you model with no pulsar wind nebula (all emission in black hole)?
 * A: PWN can explain GeV but not TeV.  PWN not needed for TeV.  But, PWN could
   still account for some GeV emission.

 * GeV and TeV could be different.  Which has worse resolution?
 * Similar resolution.  Fermi around 200 MeV ~ HESS 100 GeV.  Both have better
   resolution at higher energy.
 * Consistent with Sgr A*...
 * Fermi problem is the diffuse background; HESS doesn't have that problem

 * Q Farhad: What is the energy density of CRs for diffuse TeV emission?
 * about 100 eV cm^-3, maybe

 * Q Stocke: How much loss is there between us and CMZ due to electron/positron?  For TeV rays?
 * <10%.  Main absorber is CMB?  
 * Maybe more photons from CMZ -> greater absorption than CMZ
 * ~5% loss at highest energy only
