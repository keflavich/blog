Focus on infrared
 * high gas surface density
 * cloud-cloud collisions

Spitzer IRS survey of CMZ
 * 107 candidates
 * 35 YSOs discovered
 * half of observing time spent on background

   + 428 total spectra on ISM lines of sight

 * NeII, SII, SiII maps
 * parameter maps: 

   + ionization state
   + electron density
   + rad field hardness

Comparison to IRS observations of other galaxies
 * SINGS comparison
   + NeIII/NeII ratio vs O/H abundance
   + Galactic center is moderately inconsistent with AGN
 * Other line ratios (FeII/NeII vs SiII/SIII) - GC offset from AGNagain
   + Most CMZ points look like "normal" star forming regions
   + lots of scatter, but trend with longitude
 * photoionization by hot stars & shocks explain colors

Questions
---------

 * Q: Is there any significance to the idea that high-latitude are most similar
   to AGN?
 * A: ...didn't understand question... talked about oxygen abundance
   determinations and statistical significance

 * Q: Is there any *physical* significance to the high-latitude points having
   AGN colors?  Could it be from AGN being "turned off" years ago?
 * A: you tell me.  Could be X-ray binaries, wolf-rayet stars.  No clear
   evidence that Sgr A* excited it.
 * Q: Need bright source.  XRBs would have to be very bright.
 * A: Our obs don't show much.  Distance unknown.  Could be foreground.

 * Q Stocke: - detections of Ne V.  Couldn't see.  How many had Ne V definitely
   detected?  In infrared or diffuse?
 * A: ~12 out of 400 detected.  Mostly Ne V in ISM, not in point sources.

 * Q Farhad: What does # of detected YSOs tell you about SFR?  How are they
   distributed in plane? 
 * A: Consistent with Schmidt law.  Not far from Farhad's measurement.
   YSOs selected on IR photometry.  50% of sources from near Sgr B.
