Summary of Hi-Gal: 
  * 900hrs, 
  * inner ±60 deg, then outer ±60 deg, then full 360 deg.  
  * Release scheduled late in 2013.  
  * 0.5 million band-merged sources

The CMZ:

  * we live in a mildly barred galaxy
  * NGC 1097 as an analog
  * our CMZ less symmetric

Multiwave comparison:

  * asymmetry: 24, 70 right; gas left
  * snrs, evolved stars, nonthermal filaments, arched filaments...

The Gas:

  * 10^7 Msun
  * CMZ clouds more massive, more turbulent
  * Cold gas to the left of Sgr B2, warmer to the right
  * Column density somewhat flat from l=1.5 to l=0
    + "Optically thick as a brick"
  * Molinari "ring" - column density, some evidence from velocities
    + vertical oscillation = 2x circular speed
    + offset...
    + predicts Sgr B2 at tangent of ring

      - velocity of Sgr B2 too slow
      - Sgr B2 has significant proper motion: 80 km/s

    + Molinari ring falsified: must extend to larger long
  * Few point sources in the Arched Filaments

Sofue-Handa ('84) lobe:
 * brightest super-bubble in galaxy
 * powered by AGN or starburst?
 * Warning: Lots of foreground towards CMZ.  
   + Sco-Cen group
   + radio emission associated with wall of scocen

Sgr B2 spectroscopy:
 * Two temperature components in Sgr B2
 * PACS sees 300K CO

Sgr C mention

Bania's clump
 * 200 km/s linewidth

The Brick
 * most extreme IRDC
 * 24, 70 opaque
 * HCO+ cubes

Dust
 * Are dust grains different?
 * Temperature differs between gas and dust

Questions:
 * COMMENT: NGC 1068 has 100 pc molecular ring, will mention later in discussion
 

 * Lang: Sources in arched filaments - are they aligned with filament?
 * A: Yes, 50-60 in filament.  SEDs look like protostars.
 

 * Jerry (?): Note - hard to avoid conical wind from Sgr A* dynamically.
 * Bally: Yes.  High-latitude CO gas off-plane: entrained.  Starburst likely, AGN
   unlikely to entrain it.

 
 * Jay Gallagher: M82 energy density ~100x higher than in MW, driving wind out of
   smaller potential.  Galaxy requires huge pressure change.
 * Bally: Yes, wimpy nucleus
 

 * Michael: Evidence for bar from cobe & spitzer.  Is it related to gas bar?
 * Bally: Related.  Gas bar 20 ±3 from line of sight, but infrared stellar bar
   more like 45 degrees.  Why offset? controversial.  Generically related.
