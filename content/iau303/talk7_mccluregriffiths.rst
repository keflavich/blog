Outflows - M82 example

Our Galaxy 

 * 8.3um correlated with radio continuum
 * Fermi bubbles
 * Radio polarization - magnetized bubble
 * ATCA + Parkes HI survey
 * HI data publicly available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2438, http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/HI/sgps/queryForm.html
   + 86 high latitude clouds that are completely distinct from the rest
   + Â± 200 km/s
   + negative velocities at the bottom
   + size ~15 pc, ~few hundred Msun
   + 4000K clouds
   + n~1cm^-3
   + not in circular orbits

Lockman "very dumb simulation"
 * model as outflowing clouds
 * wind velocity, outflow angle
 * min/max velocity plots: look for clouds beyond the min/max vel
   + wind velocities 150-270 km/s can reproduce population

Cooper 2008, Melioli 2013
 * simulations predict entrainment of dense gas
 * cold wind is responsible
 * 2 Myr to get clouds to observed height 

Wind dynamics
 * cold clumps entrained in hot outflow
   total mass ~4x10^4, but completeness loss -> 10^5 msun
 * energy total ~10^52 erg
 * easily supplied by present SFR

Future
 * can look further in both lat & long
   + determine lifetime
   + constrain opening angle

Questions
---------
 * Q: Where does the mass come from?  Is it hard to resupply?  Where does it go?
 
 * Q: Do you see any warm gas (H-alpha)?
 * A: looked at WHAM, but resolution too poor.  Not clear yet.

 * Q Mitch: 600 km/s.  Injected explosively or must go through a sonic point
     with a grav. potential, which would imply that it's coming from a black hole
 * A: OK, great, someone else give me the theoretical explanation

 * Q Stocke: Warm component has been detected in absorption against AGN; velocities consistent.
     Gas goes up to 12 kpc on either side and does not escape.
     Hot wind requires Chandra, not yet successful.

 * Q: for Stocke - How much gas in hot wind?
 * A: Not detected

 * Q: Could this be inflow?
 * A: We don't see this around other parts of the galaxy except around superbubbles. 
   No conspiracy accreting towards CMZ

 * Q Farhad: We've looked at RRLs in inner degree.   Don't see any
   high-velocity ionized gas.  Must be accelerated away from disk.

 * Q Namir Kassim: High energy emission from cosmic rays impacting these clouds?
 * A: Possibly, we'd like to look at that more
