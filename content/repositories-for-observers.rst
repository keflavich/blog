I should have posted these a while ago....
`casaradio`_ is a subversion repository for folks at `The Center for
Astrophysics and Space Astronomy at CU Boulder`_ to post radio astronomy
related codes. So far, emphasizes single dish (GBT, Arecibo), but will
include EVLA, CARMA, and ALMA eventually.
`aposoftware`_ is a similar page, but is a mercurial repository and is
meant to include instrument-specific software for the `Apache Point
Observatory`_ `3.5m telescope`_. Right now includes a TUI script or two
and the TSPEC and DIS IRAF-twodspec pipelines.
I'd be remiss to leave out the `BGPS pipeline`_ even though it's
mentioned on the previous post.
Also, `agpy`_ is my personal code repository.
