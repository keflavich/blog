New unix stuff!
This is, again, stuff I'd searched for forever but never found the right
collection of terms. This is what bash readline is REALLY all about.
if you make an inputrc file, you can get awesome readline capabilities
(similar to ipython). `This post at lifehacker`_ showed me how to do it.
`This site`_ has a more complete description of how to use
readline/inputrc.
Even better: `VI command line editing`_.
There's also something called `magic space`_ but I don't know what
purpose it serves all the time... it will replace 'magic' characters
like !\* and !& and !! with whatever command they represent if you hit
space immediately after typing them (explained better `here`_).
Wow. Awesome.
