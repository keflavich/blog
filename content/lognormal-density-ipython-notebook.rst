An experiment with log normal density distributions (simple, pretty
obvious) and a test of including ipython notebooks in blog posts. To do
this, I created a gist (https://gist.github.com/3750781) and used the
ipython notebook viewer (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/3750781/) to render
the notebook in HTML. It worked pretty well; all I had to do was c&p the
source and then change 2 lines of the style (background color -> black,
foreground color -> white for the markup... maybe I should do it for the
rest too).


Comparison of the derived power spectra and density PDFs for lognormal
power distributions. Obviously (if you think about it), the power
spectra are always flat for randomly distributed signal. The PDFs change
significantly.
