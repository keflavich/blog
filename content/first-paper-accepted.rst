`My Comps II paper on IRAS 05358+3543`_ was accepted by ApJ on
Wednesday. It will show up on arxiv in a few days and I'll post the link
then. Unfortunately, there were significant problems rendering the
paper, so I recommend downloading my version.
Also, working on the HISA KDA... `I have a nice section of cutouts`_
