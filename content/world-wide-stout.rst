Last night, had ~4oz of `Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout`_. It was the
Nov 2007 batch and was WAY too sweet. Just like the `Stone Russian
Imperial Stout`_, it was almost undrinkably sweet, so I recapped it and
am going to "cellar" it (at 78 degrees, yikes) for a few months. The
Stone brew turned out a lot better on the second try, I hope the Dogfish
Head does too.
I also had a bottle of Young's Double Chocolate Stout. Oddly, they don't
have it on `their website`_. It has a strong chocolate flavor at the
start, but it fades quickly into a generic, strongly carbonated stout -
it's nothing special after the first taste.
