I had a few productive hours after my run, then things kinda went
downhill.... in the morning, I wrote two `guides`_ and then taught
someone else to use that stuff and then I tried to write up my lecture
for tomorrow and totally failed. I didn't accomplish anything after
about 1 pm. Lesson to me: don't ride no-coffee days at work.
