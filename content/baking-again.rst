Since I totally ran out of food last night (ate my last frozen pizza), I
decided it's time to try my hand at cooking things again. That will
start with making a bunch of dough, possibly shaping it, and freezing
some, fridging some, etc. Homemade pizza is way better.
Need to get pine nuts. 'n stuff.
