Tried this 9.2% bomber last night, and even drinking it over the course
of an hour and a half I could feel my nose not feeling afterwards.
The pour was probably the most exciting part of this beer. It came out
an extremely dark, rich, thick motor-oil looking thing with nearly no
head. The flavor, though, is of a very bitter and very dry imperial
stout. I didn't get much of the chocolate tone, because I only taste
chocolate when it is sweetened - bakers chocolate doesn't taste like
chocolate to me. I think this beer would have been better if kept a
little bit sweeter, much unlike the other Imperial stouts I've tried
lately.
