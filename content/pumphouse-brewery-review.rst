Went to the pumphouse brewery last night and 'tasted' 4 beers.
First, for a brewpub, it's pretty weird to serve tastes in single-sip
servings, but that's what they did. They didn't charge, so I didn't
object, but it was difficult to get a strong sense for what the beers
were meant to be.
Beers:
Cherry Saison: light colored, mild cherry flavor, no sweetness or depth
to match the cherry flavor
Ginger saison: strong ginger flavor, no depth or interesting beer
flavor. Like a dry but strong ginger ale
Saison: just... average
Copper: Weak flavored reddish beer
