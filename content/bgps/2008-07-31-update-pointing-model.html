Update - Pointing Model  7/31/08<br />The pointing model application "works" now, but I have a problem with our model. We don't get down to the <10" RMS offset we're looking for. The mean offsets are all zero, but the spread is more like 20".<br /><br />Example plots on milkyway:  [see attached PDFs too]<br />/scratch/adam_work/plots/models_ptgmdl_0506.ps<br />/scratch/adam_work/plots/models_ptgmdl_0707.ps<br />/scratch/adam_work/plots/models_rawcsoptg_0506.ps<br />/scratch/adam_work/plots/models_rawcsoptg_0707.ps<br /><br />On the left side are plotted "all" of the data points, on the right I've used a two-iteration 3-sigma rejection to eliminate outliers to a small degree.<br /><br />Top of these plots - as labeled - is altoff vs. alt, bottom is azoff vs. alt.<br /><br />The red lines are a 2nd order polynomial fit to the data.<br />The cyan lines are the pointing model corrections calculated by Meredith.<br /><br />The 'ptgmdl' files have had the pointing model corrections applied. Note that they are centered around offsets of zero.<br />The 'rawcsoptg' files DO NOT have pointing model corrections applied, and FZAO/FAZO have been REMOVED from the original pointing. Hence, these are RAW CSO TELESCOPE POINTING plots.<br /><br />Things to note:<br /><br />    * In the 0707 'ptgmdl' set, the az is not quite centered at zero<br />    * the 0506 'ptgmdl' set still has bulk offsets<br />    * the ALTOFF and AZOFF are in delta-coordinate: this means that azoff should be scaled by dividing by cos(alt) to put the y-axis in consistent units. In most cases, this means that the already large spread at higher altitudes is going to INCREASE. That means the problem is going to get worse...<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />   1. What is the main difference between my plots and Meredith's? i.e. why is my RMS ~an order of magnitude larger?<br />   2. Does more outlier rejection make sense? Is there any reason not to trust certain observations if they visible turn out right?<br /><br /><br /><br />PPSes are supposed to be "absolute references" for the 1x1, 3x1 maps<br />OLD PROBLEM: PPS and large maps mapped with same 'pointing model' but ended up with different coordinates</div>
