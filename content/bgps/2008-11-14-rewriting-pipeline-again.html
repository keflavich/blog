Not entirely, but I realized my code had become... clunky, at best.<br /><br />I'm rewriting the wrappers using structs.  I HATE IDL structs, but they're necessary.... if only they would make them dynamically modifiable.<br /><br />Weighting worked to some degree, the mapping is pretty much done.</div>
