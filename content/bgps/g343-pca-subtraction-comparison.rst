From top-left to the blue highlighted box, the 20th iteration of N pca
components subtracted is shown. N goes from 1 to 19. The other plots are
'ascending' and 0-pca components with median and baseline subtraction -
ask if you want more details on those.
19 iterations recovers a LOT of flux. I haven't generated the plots for
flux as a function of iteration, but I have software to do that
available.
Things to note: at 10 iterations and higher, you start to generate
negative bowls.
One observation is probably independently responsible for the chunks of
glitchy data present even in the 19 PCA component subtraction. While the
bowls do worsen with higher number of PCA components, we also find
fainter structure (e.g. those tongues to the southeast and northwest).
