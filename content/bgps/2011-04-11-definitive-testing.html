<div class='post'>
It is now possible to make artificial timestreams!<br /><br />First round of tests:<br />For pointing maps with ~21 scans in 15" steps, array angle is approximately negligible.<br />deconv does NOT recover point sources, but reconv does (perfectly)<br />The algorithm starts to decay and produce weird ringey residuals at a S/N ~300.  The residuals are only at the 1% level out to S/N ~1000.</div>
