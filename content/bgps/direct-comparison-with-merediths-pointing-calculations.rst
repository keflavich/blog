I've gotten to the point that I'm directly comparing my pointing
calculations to Merediths. So far, it looks like:
1. I can very nearly reproduce Meredith's results on her maps, though
there are a few differences in centroids and I missed the source a few
times where she didn't.
2. There is still a spread between my map centroids and hers.
The code I've written to enable this comparison:
publish/debug\_testing/compare\_me\_meredith.pro
I'm still a bit stumped, but I think I have a path to the answer mapped
out.
