Open topic - what needs to be done to put the new pipeline on the CVS?

#. Under the assumption that it will be used by others, the
   documentation needs to be complete.
#. Needs to be compatible with current pipeline (no name overlap)
#. Have to fix / update some Goddard astrolib routines that have short
   integer for loops and need long integer for loops
    -which ones?
#. Probably need to add instrument specific pointing model corrections
   for non-BGPS observations
