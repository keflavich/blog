Look at that zoomed in. Note that the first 20ish are from 0507. I don't
know what's causing the double source. Maybe a 90 degree rotation would
do it, I don't know. I do know that I'm applying an array angle of 76.2
degrees for those July observations and 113.6 degrees for the June 05
observations. Maybe that got swapped or something....
It looks like Meredith ran into the same problems when mapping 0506, but
not 0507.

comparing mine to hers (I even used the same downsampled/cleand file),
it is obvious that something went wrong with the mapping. I tested a
number of different fiducial array angles and none of them generated
real maps, so the mapping is correct except for offsets in the scan
direction, as usual. What the heck.
