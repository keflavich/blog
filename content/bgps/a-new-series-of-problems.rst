#. There are severe (~5 pixel) pointing offsets in the MOSAICs. They are
   caused by IRAF and I can't figure out exactly why.
#. Deconvolution has created more artifacts at l=54, 70, 357. I don't
   know how to fix them.
#. Either my earlier time estimates were way off, or the mapping has

   before it was taking closer to 48.
