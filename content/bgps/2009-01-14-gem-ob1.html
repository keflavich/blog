<div class='post'>
With Miranda's help, I discovered some serious errors in Gem OB1 and fixed them.<br /><br /><ol><br /><li> L189 was using L134 data for no apparent reason<br /><li> many September 2007 observations have the WRONG rotation angle in place in array_params!  Unfortunately it's not clear yet which ones suffer from this problem: I need a list of when rotangle was/was not used, and it looks like it'll be a pain to fix the problem.<br /><li> GemOB1link wasn't mapped, it will be now.<br /></ol></div>
