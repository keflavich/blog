There are a few cases in the L=30 field that look awful. 050706\_o31
probably observed the inside of the dish. 070727\_ob6 shows some
streaking that I can't easily explain... though it appears that there
are some bad bolos that need to get flagged out. I wonder if that's
systematic over 070727 observations....
