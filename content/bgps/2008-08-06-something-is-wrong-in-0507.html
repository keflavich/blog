Note that the first 20ish are from 0507.  I don't know what's causing the double source.  Maybe a 90 degree rotation would do it, I don't know.  I do know that I'm applying an array angle of 76.2 degrees for those July observations and 113.6 degrees for the June 05 observations.  Maybe that got swapped or something....<br /><br />It looks like Meredith ran into the same problems when mapping 0506, but not 0507.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/SJo7MpPYjDI/AAAAAAAADNg/6_pSjjeKjLM/s1600-h/g34_0507_compare.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/SJo7MpPYjDI/AAAAAAAADNg/6_pSjjeKjLM/s320/g34_0507_compare.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5231559005559098418" border="0" /></a><br />comparing mine to hers (I even used the same downsampled/cleand file), it is obvious that something went wrong with the mapping.  I tested a number of different fiducial array angles and none of them generated real maps, so the mapping is correct except for offsets in the scan direction, as usual.  What the heck.</div>
