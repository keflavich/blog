Look at the left plots in #1 and #4, and ignore the red lines. The RMS
is 4.87 in alt, 3.51 in az, using all pointing observations in 0707
(i.e. not splitting it into part1/part2 or refining heavily). Total is
6.003", not bad.
I'm calling it quits on pointing refinement for the moment; I'm
satisfied using Meredith's pointing models to get science maps
co-aligned, then we'll use my model on the PPSes to get the pointing to
maximum precision.
Also, in the galactic center, the mapping works happily now. No more
silly problems with that.
It's time for a real Next Step. I think that means mapping nearly
everything. Well, here goes!
