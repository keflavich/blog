a few items...

#. I requested that pyraf be installed on milkyway. I don't really want
   to deal with xgterm/xterm issues when remotely logging in.
#. I'm writing up a 'script' on
   `http://sites.google.com/site/bolocam/pipeline/alignment`_. I believe
   IRAF is capable of interacting with DS9 even if images are not opened
   from IRAF, which should allow you to circumvent the 9-frame limit.
#. Most of the individual image fields are done now. There may be a few
   stragglers, but those are ones that either didn't have an
   \_infile.txt or only had single observations. What do we do about
   those fields? They'll be undersampled!
