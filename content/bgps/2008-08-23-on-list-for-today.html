Since my gigantic mapping run is still going, I'm going to work primarily on developing code for testing the maps, and determining important information about the mapper.<br /><br />The data paper will require an iteration-to-convergence figure, or at least an estimate of degree of convergence.<br /><ol><li>Need to develop code to show iteration-to-convergence<br /><ol type="a"><li> need it for both NxNpca and ascending/descending</li><li>have to use region files?  make some sort of region reader?</li><li>pick demonstration sources</li></ol></li><li>Compare N<sub>pca</sub> results for bright, faint sources</li><li>Compare iterating with/without deconvolution</li><li>Compare median/average/baseline sky subtraction</li><li>Analyze efficiency...</li><li>Try to figure out what's causing huge offsets.
