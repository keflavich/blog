I'm running 0,1,2,3,5,7,10,16, and 19 PCA component 51 iteration maps of
Gem OB1 with deconvolution. No clue when they'll be done because they're
at the end of a long queue.
Next (important!) step is to re-run the simulations with linear source
sizes but with different numbers of PCA components, different kernel
sizes, etc..... there is a LOT of parameter space to cover.
