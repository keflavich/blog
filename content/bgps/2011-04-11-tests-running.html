<ul><li> Re-doing December 2010 calibration (remember to check & compare AFGL 4029)<br /><li> Mapping L351 with deconv, reconv, nodeconv<br /></ul><br />ARGH something is wrong with l351 pointing!  Is the pointing model broken?  What HAPPENED?!<br /><br /><br />OK, on to 4/8/2011 stuff:<br />I've done more work on the Memo from a few weeks ago, and now have a concrete recommendation that we do some more observing in 2011.  Why I torture myself so, I do not know....<br /><br />Examination of the 2009 tests shows that reconv is by far the superior approach for pointing observations as previously noted.  Since reconv doesn't look bad, but definitely not best, for science, it might be the compromise we have to make.  nodeconv completely fails for ds5 data, but the ds5 data in general are abominable.  They drop by 15-20% compared to ds1 for Mars.  The problem with nodeconv appears to be extremely high noise maps.<br /><br /><br /><br />...again, forgot to post this on Friday...</div>
