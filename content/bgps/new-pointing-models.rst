I decided to try to fit the pointing model as a full alt/az or ra/dec
dependent thing using mpfitfun and a 12 (or 16) parameter model. It
didn't work very well.
I could fit out the alt dependence, then independently fit out the az
dependence, and see how that goes. I think it will work brilliantly.
