<div class='post'>
Despite a slew of alignment errors, it appears that the alignment for MOST fields turns out OK using Method 3 of the pixel-shift code; the signal to noise is VERY low in a lot of fields.<br /><br />070724_o38 does not come up with a good fit, for very good reason - there appears to be no signal at all.<br /><br />070907_o20 is a problem.  The offset was 27 pixels, which is too large, but nonetheless correct.  I had to institute the plane fitter at an earlier stage to get it to work.<br /><br />However, the biggest problem: the SCUBA source aligns with 070907_o20 but not the rest of the maps.  So I needed to re-fit everything.  That was a BIG mistake, we need to check carefully for it in other fields.</div>
