It's definitely important to get rid of the spikes and, more importantly, the exponential decay.  The current function is pretty good, but possibly not good enough because there are some situations in which the turnaround decay is obviously not well-enough dealt with and results in high/low streaks.<br /><br />The glitches can be ~20 Jy.  The problem is that they sometimes show up in the middle of sources (e.g. in 060609_o26).  That will badly distort fluxes. <br /><br />My ideal is still to use a median instead of mean combination of data points into image points, but that seems to be impractical to implement.  Other ideas...</div>
