<div class='post'>
There are a few cases in the L=30 field that look awful.  050706_o31 probably observed the inside of the dish.  070727_ob6 shows some streaking that I can't easily explain... though it appears that there are some bad bolos that need to get flagged out.  I wonder if that's systematic over 070727 observations....</div>
