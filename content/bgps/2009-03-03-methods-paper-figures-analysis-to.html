The methods paper needs some justification of the number of PCA components used.  This will require a map of some field with a range of number of PCA components.  <br /><br />Plan:<br />simulate a map of L111 (the most square field) with 0-20 PCA components x 21 iterations and a variety of source sizes and plot the recovered flux vs. number of PCA components.  Ideally, do this with both deconvolution and not.  Estimated processing time is ~24 hours.<br /><br />Also, a plot of flux vs. iteration number will be useful.<br /><br /><br />Glitch filtering method has been modified:<br />"Glitches are removed by drizzling each bolometer measurement into a given pixel using the mapping M[p], but retaining each pixel as an array of measurements.  Then, measurements exceeding $3\times MAD$ (Median Average Deviation) are flagged out in the timestream.  In cases where there were too few ($<3$) hits per pixel, the pixel was completely flagged out.  This only occurred for pixels at scan edges."<br /><br /><br /><br />Data flagging:<br />Partly covered by deglitching.  Many scans were flagged by hand to remove overly noisy scans and those that were observed to confuse the iterative mapper.  Hand flagging is more robust than automated and can remove features caused by the filter convolved with the glitch.<br /><br /><br />Creation of astrophysical model:<br />Not entirely sure what this section entails.  Should have a subsection on deconvolution though.<br /><br />Jackknifing has not generally been done...</div>
