/scratch/adam_work/plots/models_myptgmdl_0707.ps<br /><br />Look at the left plots in #1 and #4, and ignore the red lines.  The RMS is 4.87 in alt, 3.51 in az, using all pointing observations in 0707 (i.e. not splitting it into part1/part2 or refining heavily).   Total is 6.003", not bad.<br /><br />I'm calling it quits on pointing refinement for the moment; I'm satisfied using Meredith's pointing models to get science maps co-aligned, then we'll use my model on the PPSes to get the pointing to maximum precision.<br /><br />Also, in the galactic center, the mapping works happily now.  No more silly problems with that.<br /><br />It's time for a real Next Step.  I think that means mapping nearly everything.  Well, here goes!</div>
