<ol><br /><li> There are severe (~5 pixel) pointing offsets in the MOSAICs.  They are caused by IRAF and I can't figure out exactly why.<br /><li> Deconvolution has created more artifacts at l=54, 70, 357.  I don't know how to fix them.<br /><li> Either my earlier time estimates were way off, or the mapping has gotten slower.  It now takes ~120 computer hours (72 real hours) where before it was taking closer to 48.<br /></ol></div>
