<div class='post'>
I'm running 0,1,2,3,5,7,10,16, and 19 PCA component 51 iteration maps of Gem OB1 with deconvolution.  No clue when they'll be done because they're at the end of a long queue.<br /><br />Next (important!) step is to re-run the simulations with linear source sizes but with different numbers of PCA components, different kernel sizes, etc..... there is a LOT of parameter space to cover.</div>
