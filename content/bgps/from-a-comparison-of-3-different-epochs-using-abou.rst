From a comparison of 3 different epochs using about a dozen different
reduction techniques, but all with pairs of cross-scans, ds1 is
uniformly higher than ds5.
The only thing left to do is compare the individual scans, I suppose...
if the cross-scans behave differently, that explains the difference
between 2010 and other epochs
