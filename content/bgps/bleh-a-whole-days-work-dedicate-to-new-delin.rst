Bleh, a whole day's work dedicate to new delining methods and testing.
Very unrewarding. However, there are results that I need to FINALLY
prove and show tomorrow:
1. amplitude suppression + phase preservation is a good alternative to
zeroing/scrambling or replacing with noise
2. line fitting is effective but slow
3. Assuming a line profile and suppressing is nearly as effective as
line fitting
4. scan-by-scan is less effective than observation-by-observation for
fitting (but it's not clear if that holds for other methods)
