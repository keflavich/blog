I cut down the number of maps made by the pipeline from 80 to 30 by merging regions with severe overlap.  I don't think this will result in any net change in efficiency of the mapping process because a few of the maps will go over to swap, but it will reduce the amount of overlap / noisy edges and make debugging simpler.  It should also reduce hard drive usage once I decide that I'm satisfied with the results and remove the old (v0.6) redundant data.<br /><br />As part of this process, the reference fields for coalignment have been re-set to the v0.6.2 coadds + some (crappy) mosaics from v0.6.2 so that we no longer need to rely on 3x1's for the alignment.<br /><br />See /data/bgps/releases/v0.7/readme.txt for details (reproduced below)<br /><br />Created 01/14/09<br />Version 0.7 does not exist yet.
