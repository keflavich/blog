DS9 does something intuitive: cd0_0 and cd1_1 multiplied by the x,y pixel difference gets you the new l,b coordinate.  I think this is very likely to be correct on the galactic plane.  IDL does something different.  I don't know why different, or really how - it's buried somewhere in wcsxy2sph - but it's definitely different.  Which is right?</div>
