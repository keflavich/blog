Between sign errors, failures to fit, and.... I really don't know WHAT
was going on, I finally figured out how to get the cursed distortion
mapping to work. I still haven't even started testing, unfortunately.
I don't know why I can fit the way the OP did, fitting R and Theta, and
I apparently can't fit x,y. It's frustrating.
