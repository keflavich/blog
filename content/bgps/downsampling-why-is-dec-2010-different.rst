As you'll recall from `my previous post`_ (and references therein...),
the 2005 Orion data shows a discrepancy between ds1 and ds5 data in
which the ds1 data is significantly (~10%) higher than the ds5 data.
However, the 2010 Uranus observations show much larger discrepancies
between ds1 and ds5 favoring the ds5 data! Because that was somewhat
unbelievable to me, I ran ds1-ds5 comparisons on Uranus data from other
epochs, and discovered that ds1>ds5 uniformly (also, it looks a LOT
better).
So, the question remains, WHY is the Dec 2010 data brighter in ds5? More
confusing to me, why do the ds5 PSFs from 2010 look so reasonable, while
the ds5 PSFs from all earlier epochs look terrible?
For example, I use the observations 070727\_o31 and \_o32. These show
clearly the blurring and flux-loss that happens when ds5 data are used
for 'normal' point-sources:
