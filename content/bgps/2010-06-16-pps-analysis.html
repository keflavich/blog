I've started looking at PPS fields to see if I can glean any additional information about the "flux discrepancy" from them.&nbsp; However, the results are, as usual, unenlightening.<br /><br />There is no consistent increase in flux when 3 PCA components are used instead of 13 PCA components - very plausibly an indication that 13 PCA is not too much to subtract because it's only atmosphere.&nbsp; Similarly, there is no obvious benefit to using a quadratic sky estimator instead of a PCA estimator.<br /><br />I'm using aperture photometry (without background subtraction) on identical fields to perform these comparisons.&nbsp; I've selected (arbitrarily) the l357pps source as my comparison source.&nbsp; The next step (ongoing) is to compare to the co-added maps and crosshatched large-scale maps of the same field.<br /><br />(next step) PPS &lt; single cross-hatched large-scale observation pair &lt; 13PCA full combined map &lt; 3PCA full combined map.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this result implies that the small maps under-recover flux, which suggests that the large maps are too bright, which is the opposite of what we expect.&nbsp; Additionally, lower noise -&gt; more flux recovered?<br /><br />When background subtraction is included, the 3PCA and 13PCA fluxes match nearly perfectly.<br /><br />Despite the failure of this test (PPS &lt; full field), I will do a systematic comparison of PPS sources with 0PCA + masking to the large fields in the hopes that doing so can provide a legitimate estimate of the "scale factor" from treating small and large fields differently.</div>
