Who knew?<br /><br />Whole observation took 3965.3506 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3071.1403 sec.<br />Whole observation took 4205.3337 sec.<br />Whole observation took 7362.5490 sec.<br />Whole observation took 9313.6064 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3755.2383 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3755.8278 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3760.7032 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3758.5719 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3763.1436 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3766.0066 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3789.5806 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3760.9774 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3762.7124 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3763.1120 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3767.1255 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3766.9085 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3758.5867 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3760.2131 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3755.8963 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3759.9199 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3764.4494 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3766.9686 sec.<br />Whole observation took 3756.5876 sec.<br /><br /><br />The good news is that I haven't encountered any crashes.
