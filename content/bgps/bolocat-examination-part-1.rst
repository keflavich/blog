This figure shows the flux recovery of bolocat. The Y axis shows the
Input flux (green) and the Filtered flux (blue/cyan/purple) with a few
different large-scale filters. The red line is the 1-1 line. Obviously,
bolocat doesn't recover everything that was there - we removed a lot of
flux, so recovery fractions are in the few % range. However, bolocat
does a much better job than the simple filter at recovering positive
fluxes. Therefore, the filter function still isn't good enough.
