Discovered that the flagger causes some pretty serious problems if you try to run it on a non-coadd for obvious reasons: there's practically no coverage!  Individual maps should NOT go through the flagger, so I have added a piece of code that turns off the flagger if only one observation is being used.  That code is in map_iter where the flagger is called.</div>
