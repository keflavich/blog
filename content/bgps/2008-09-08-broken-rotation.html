I have to echo James in saying how remarkable it is than anything I ever did worked at all!  I'm growing more and more certain that I've been double-correcting rotation for the past 2 months, and my maps don't look all that bad!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/SMW4oOPcLaI/AAAAAAAADXw/1ARG8iyVXDQ/s1600-h/070717_o15_rotations.png"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/SMW4oOPcLaI/AAAAAAAADXw/1ARG8iyVXDQ/s400/070717_o15_rotations.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243800342299946402" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Image caption: <br />Top left - both PA and rotang<br />Top right - neither<br />Bottom left - rotang only<br />Bottom right - PA only<br /><br />I'm running the same sort of comparison on all of the GC and L=24 data.  Check out /scratch/adam_work/ROT_TEST for the results.  I'll be updating this when I've completed that analysis.<br /><br />Update 6:35 PM: !@#$, etc.  New problem child:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/SMXFUjLjRGI/AAAAAAAADX4/aynvuycRzGM/s1600-h/060603_o16_rotations.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/SMXFUjLjRGI/AAAAAAAADX4/aynvuycRzGM/s400/060603_o16_rotations.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243814297974555746" /></a><br /><br />Image caption (same as above, luckily): <br />Top left - both PA and rotang<br />Top right - neither<br />Bottom left - rotang only<br />Bottom right - PA only<br /><br />So, can anyone tell me which one of THESE is right?  Because I can't.  Top left is 'correct' except that it's not.<br /><br />Update 7:10 PM: I compared adding/subtracting PA and RA, and I can say this:  subtracting PA never works.  Adding/subtracting RA works variably.<br /><br />I think I'm done testing parameter space.  I haven't had very good luck doing parameter space tests in the past; it usually is more beneficial to take a step back and try to think through the problem.<br /><br />Update 7:30 PM: Fixed.  Much as this looks like a short-lived, easily solved problem, it was one of the most subtle and insidious errors I've made.  I got extremely lucky that plotting PA and ROTANGLE happened to spark off warning sirens in my mind about the positioning of the variable names.  I wouldn't normally look for that.</div>
