<div class='post'>
I started working again yesterday, mostly looking at the 31PCA reductions I did.  I have no strong opinions yet on their quality.<br /><br />It's time to work towards a final data release, though, and to that end, I'm going to start removing duplicate fields.  e.g. l023 and l024 have identical data, so only one of them should ever be used.</div>
