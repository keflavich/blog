I've gotten to the point that I'm directly comparing my pointing calculations to Merediths.  So far, it looks like:<br />1. I can very nearly reproduce Meredith's results on her maps, though there are a few differences in centroids and I missed the source a few times where she didn't.<br />2. There is still a spread between my map centroids and hers.<br /><br />The code I've written to enable this comparison: publish/debug_testing/compare_me_meredith.pro<br /><br />I'm still a bit stumped, but I think I have a path to the answer mapped out.</div>
