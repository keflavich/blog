I updated the FITS header writing pieces of the software today, we should now have:<br />N_PCA<br />ITERNUM<br />PPBEAM<br /><br />in all new maps.<br /><br />I'm mapping all of Cygnus degree-by-degree in RA/Dec and Galactic to try to measure offsets... possibly offsets as a function of l/b or ra/dec.  I should really be doing this with PPSes, though.<br /><br />My priority list:<br /><ol><li>find out what's causing bulk offsets</li><li>beat down noise in my pointing models by rejecting bad sources/points [has to be done from campus]<br /></li><li>test my personal special pointing models</li><li>make maps!</li><li>figure out the rest of pointing<br /></li></ol></div>
