What's up with that?  Apparently I'm preferentially subtracting certain scales but I don't know why, unless deconvolution is at fault.<br /><br /><br />Edit/Update: The deconvolution is definitely at fault.  Here's the same scan done without deconvolution:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/SR4ZM6FPfrI/AAAAAAAADf0/baHOQwedeqs/s1600-h/psds2.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 239px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/SR4ZM6FPfrI/AAAAAAAADf0/baHOQwedeqs/s400/psds2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268676323610427058" /></a><br /><br />It should have been obvious; the cyan in the first plot is the PSD of the deconvolution straight up, and that should have no high-frequency structure...</div>
