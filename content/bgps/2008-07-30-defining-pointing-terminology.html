There has been a lot of confusion about pointing terminology.<br /><br /><ul><li>CSO pointing model: the telescope pointing model used and written as a black box </li><br /><ul><li> has already been corrected for aberration/nutation </li><br /><li> is in current epoch coordinates (e.g. J2007.34) </li></ul><br /><li> Instrument-specific correction to pointing model </li><br /><ul><li> ??? also referred to as 't terms' </li><br /><li> is offset between CSO pointing model and real locations </li><br /><li> should be a function of alt (and maybe az) </li><br /><li> is recorded in "RPC" files </li><br /><li> is in units of distance on the sky: delta-RA and delta-DEC, or delta-ALT and delta-AZ will be in the same units, while if they were in coordinate units delta-RA and delta-AZ would have to be scaled by 1/cos(DEC) or 1/cos(ALT) respectively<br /></li></ul><br /><li> FAZO and FZAO: Fixed Azimuth Offset and Fixed Zenith Angle Offset<br /><ul> <li> these are ambiguously defined in the pipeline code </li><br /><li> ???? FAZO/FZAO include both the functional instrument specific pointing offset and any manual changes made at the telescope [manual only relevant to 2007 observations] </li><br /><li> ???? or are these JUST fixed offsets, and the instrument specific corrections are not included?  Either way, how can I separate out manually-applied fixed offsets from fitted-model offsets? </li> </ul><br /></li></ul></div>
