In case anyone is wondering why Milkyway is going really slowly, I'm mapping a 69-observation set of Cygnus.  It ought to prove to be an interesting test of Milkyway's swap capacity, but other than that I doubt it will be useful.  While the pointing is reasonably good at this point (30" still, but whatever), I haven't done ANY work on filtering out bad observations / flagging stuff in Cyg.  Data massaging is going to be a long process, it would be great if I could do that instead of pointing stuff.  Argh.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this file:<br />/scratch/sliced/l078/070702_o33_raw_ds5.nc<br />is a "_ds5.nc" but is NOT downsampled!<br /><br /><br />Update:<br />Mapped the individual files successfully, picked out noisy ones.  The overall map failed - just not enough memory to do a field that large.  I split it up in to two sets of 25 observations, plus I'll be mapping each L 70-L 90 field separately (I didn't get ride of noisy observations for this).  I'm also remapping the individual observations with PSD flagging enabled to see how that works.<br /><br />For notes on the P Cyg observations, see the file<br />/scratch/adam_work/texts/cygnus_for_pat.in</div>
