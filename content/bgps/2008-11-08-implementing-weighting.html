Not as easy as it ought to be.<br /><br /><br />I think I need to do a few things:<br />1. check and make sure there are no more of those !@#$!@#$#@% different sized array subtractions/multiplications.  'weight' and 'best_astro_model' need to have the same size & shape in mem_iter_pc<br />2. I guess just check and make sure stuff works.  The weighted mean I'm using appears to be right: sum(weight * value) / sum(weight)<br /><br />I hate making lists that end up being two items....</div>
