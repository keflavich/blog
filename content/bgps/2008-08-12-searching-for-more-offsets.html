The defining feature of my pointing calculations - and their inconsistency - is that the spread for individual sources is bad, which means that there's still something wrong in the way the bulk ra/dec are being calculated.<br /><br />I checked apply_distortion_map_radec to see if it might have inserted some bulk offset, but it only changes the average position by <2".  That might be an issue, but the boresight isn't necessarily aligned with the mean location of the bolometers.  It should be shifted by at least .3" according to a simple average of sin/cos of the bolo_params angles.<br /><br /><br />Comparing my pointing code to map_ncdf_reading directly:<br />readstruct=map_ncdf_reading(filename,/nopixoff)  <br />offsets are small (e.g.      -0.050665803   -0.0029540043 arcseconds ra/dec) if I don't subtract fazo/fzao<br />offsets in ra/dec are remarkably close to fazo/fzao if I subtract them:<br />       92.830656      -126.12773<br />       95.000000      -120.00000<br />which is because ra/dec are pretty closely aligned to az/el. <br /><br />So, any difference comes from at least one of the keyword parameters.  Therefore I AM missing something, and that something is one of the keywords to map_ncdf_reading</div>
