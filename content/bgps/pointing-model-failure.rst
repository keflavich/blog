I attempted to map L111, L033, and W3/4/5 with the pointing model
corrections applied. That was a failure. Two images are attached to
illustrate the problem - relative pointing is clearly not correct
(middle of L33, bottom left of L111).
So.... possibilities:

#. Pointing models are incorrect
#. Pointing model signs have been misinterpreted (don't think this one
   is possible based on other graphs)
#. Uhh... ideas?

Next step, I'll use the individual maps with no ptg mdl and find out
what the offsets should be....
