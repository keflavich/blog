curiously, l135p1 has a reference field that is only present in the w3ohbolocam directory.  Probably need to remake the infiles for all of W3/4/5</div>

I think l086 needs to be re-treated specially; it had way too many large offsets.  Probably the error that resulted was from an overlap region smaller than itself....</div>

/scratch/sliced/l354/070724_o10_raw_ds5.nc was the reference file for l354 but somehow was excluded from the l354_infile.  Warrants another check post-mapping</div>

somehow /scratch/sliced_polychrome/l034/050708_o21_raw_mmd_ds5.nc got into the l033_infile and screwed things up</div>
