I made a lot of mistakes in my script, so progress is about 12 computer
hours behind what it should be.
These maps are done:

Things I've learned so far:
There is an observation (a master?) in L003 that should be the galactic
center master.
L018 has some really bad noise that needs fixing.
The wackiness I saw in L024 seems to be gone now.
L044 has the same noise stripes as L357.
