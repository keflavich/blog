About milkyway?  This post is a red herring, but:<br />I decided to go ahead and run the mapper on Cygnus, L33, L111, and the Galactic Center again.  The pointing has gotten to the stage where I'm certain I can't do anything more without a stroke of pure brilliance or a conversation with someone who hasn't touched a thing - e.g. Jason - that suddenly enlightens me. <br /><br />In order to fully reproduce Meredith's results, I'd probably have to go back through and follow her 'pipeline' process step by step as well, and I suspect that, if I had used her method on her RA/Dec maps, I would have come up with exactly the same problem I currently see.  Therefore, I won't do anything about it.<br /><br />I think the most appropriate response at this point MAY be to just fit a damned polynomial/sine curve in az and include that as part of the pointing model, but I can't justify where that comes from.  All I know is that it's present in Meredith's data as well as my own.<br /><br />What's that next step with the PPSes?  We need to do that.<br /><br />More important, though, is getting some image optimization ready FAST.  I need to be running this stuff before September!  Tonight's run will be a test of numbers of PCA components.  At the very least, the v0.5 should have a consistent set of images even if we cut out the high-flux ones.  We'll deal with that later.<br /><br />For the high flux objects, e.g. g34.3, since we have so much overlapping data, a simple average/magical baseline subtraction might be just as if not more effective than PCA subtraction, so that's one way around it.</div>
