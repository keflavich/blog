Here we finally get into the meat of the simulations.  The goal is to develop realistic - but arbitrary - astrophysical models to run through simulations.<br /><br />The first step is to figure out what a realistic sky looks like.  To this end, I use the HiGal SDP fields, looking only at their power spectra.  They are well represented by a power law with &alpha; = 3 (shown in the dashed black line below).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-50R2lfaIGrY/TdvZi5tl5VI/AAAAAAAAGLQ/w45OC9dk3Rg/s1600/sdp_psds_powerlaw.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="249" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-50R2lfaIGrY/TdvZi5tl5VI/AAAAAAAAGLQ/w45OC9dk3Rg/s320/sdp_psds_powerlaw.png" /></a></div><br />Therefore, I've attempted to randomly sample from a similar power law distribution using the following IDL code:<br /><code><br />    dimsize = 512<br /><br />    realpower = realpowers[ii]<br />    imagpower = imagpowers[ii]<br />    imagscale = imagscales[ii]<br />    peakamp = 1.0<br />    noise = 0.03<br />    smoothscale = 2.0<br />    smoothkernel = psf_gaussian(npix=512,ndim=2,fwhm=31.2/7.2/2.0,/normalize)<br />    sigma_gp = 128.0 ; sigma-width of the Galactic Plane (can get more accurate value from Cara's paper)<br /><br />    xx = findgen(dimsize) #  replicate(1.0,dimsize)<br />    yy = findgen(dimsize) ## replicate(1.0,dimsize)<br />    rr = sqrt( (xx-255.5)^2 + (yy-255.5)^2 )<br />    realpart = (rr^realpower) * randomn(seed1,[dimsize,dimsize])<br />    imagpart = ((rr*imagscale)^imagpower) * randomn(seed2,[dimsize,dimsize])*complex(0,1) <br />    fakesky = abs(fft(shift(realpart + imagpart,0,0),1))<br />    expweight = exp(-(yy-255.5)^2/(2.0*sigma_gp^2)) ; most power is in the inner plane<br /><br />    fakesky *= peakamp/max(fakesky)<br />    fakesky_sm = convolve(fakesky,smoothkernel)<br />    fakesky_sm = fakesky_sm*expweight<br />    fakesky_sm += randomn(seed3,[dimsize,dimsize]) * noise<br /></code><br /><br />Since Power is the fourier-transform squared, I'm using a power-law of &alpha;=1.5 for the "real" part of the sampling.  The imaginary part follows a shallower slope to reduce the amount of power in large structures, which didn't look quite right (but maybe I should leave both slopes the same?).  With both the same, and without the imaginary part down-scaled, the structure appears too "cloudy" and not "clumpy" enough.  But back to that later...<br /><br />The peak amplitude is set by re-scaling the map.  Ideally, we'd like to see this set by a point source, since that is true in most fields.<br /><br />The noise level should not be included in simulations, but should be used to show the difference between pipeline-leftover noise and gaussian noise on the sky.  i.e., what structures disappear when you just add noise, and what structures are removed by the pipeline.<br /><br />The PSF is simply to smooth out signals that are removed by the telescope beam.  We can replace this with a "real" PSF if and when we've come up with a believable one.<br /><br />The noise is added after the smoothing because it should be on a pixel scale rather than a beam scale.<br /><br />Here are some example realizations with different power laws:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vCy9Lx2RjWw/Tdvs_PO1u6I/AAAAAAAAGLw/cc7cIupQu0U/s1600/exp7_fakesky_sm_realP-1.0_imagP-1.0_imagS01.0_seednum02.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="320" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vCy9Lx2RjWw/Tdvs_PO1u6I/AAAAAAAAGLw/cc7cIupQu0U/s320/exp7_fakesky_sm_realP-1.0_imagP-1.0_imagS01.0_seednum02.png" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qpgg2U41r6U/Tdvs_RPxARI/AAAAAAAAGL4/v5exzhhqDew/s1600/exp7_fakesky_sm_realP-1.5_imagP-1.5_imagS01.0_seednum02.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="320" width="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qpgg2U41r6U/Tdvs_RPxARI/AAAAAAAAGL4/v5exzhhqDew/s320/exp7_fakesky_sm_realP-1.5_imagP-1.5_imagS01.0_seednum02.png" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2kUqO9aE8zM/Tdvs_maHaCI/AAAAAAAAGMA/u5bDCfiVuH0/s1600/exp7_fakesky_sm_realP-2.0_imagP-2.0_imagS01.0_seednum02.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="320" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2kUqO9aE8zM/Tdvs_maHaCI/AAAAAAAAGMA/u5bDCfiVuH0/s320/exp7_fakesky_sm_realP-2.0_imagP-2.0_imagS01.0_seednum02.png" /></a></div></div>
