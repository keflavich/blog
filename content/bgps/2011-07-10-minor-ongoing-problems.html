Since I have many tasks running in parallel, I need to summarize them sometimes...<br /><br /><ol><li> There are many "bad" observations that haven't been placed in "bad" directories. A list of the error messages generated is here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bgpspipeline/wiki/MakingInfiles">Making Infiles wiki</a><br /><li> There may be streaking in the BGPS ds2 images of l030 and l032.  Still trying to re-run cleanly to find out<br /><li> There may be unflagged high-points in l030 and l032.  Also under examination<br /><li> Simulations have been generating bulk-offset outputs; my suspicion was that the relative scales were being set incorrectly because astro dominated atmo, so I bumped up the atmo scale.   The tests have run but I haven't examined the outputs<br /><li> V1 sims have shown streaking, possibly because of the previous bullet, but certainly (in part) because cross-scans haven't worked<br /></ol></div>
