<div class='post'>
No progress today.  Spent the whole day re-mapping pointing sources and figuring out which observations ARE pointing sources.  Mapping STILL not done - it takes a long time when there are hundreds of separate observations.  Also, finding some corrupt files and noting them in /scratch/adam_work/texts/toolarge.txt .  A lot more of that work to be done.</div>
