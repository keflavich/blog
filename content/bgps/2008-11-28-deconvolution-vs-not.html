I've done some by-eye comparisons of deconvolutions vs no deconvolution.  The no-deconvolution clearly does better on the bright sources: probably the deconvolved beam size is a little bit different from (larger? smaller?) the actual source size.  Deconvolution does better in putting noise from noisy regions into the noisemap and keeping it out of the astromap.<br /><br />Both might be useful - the deconvolved maps may end up being prettier, but the no-deconvolve maps will probably have more reliable fluxes.<br /><br />This all probably relies on testing / simulation.</div>
