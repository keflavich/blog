This is going to be a mishmash of various things....
First, Jared has run the same simulations I e-mailed out through the
V1.0 pipeline. Unfortunately, the results are not good - there is
substantial streaking of a variety not seen in the real data in V1.
Second, here are the simulated images from V2:

Unfortunately I can't present a direct comparison because something got
screwed up...
