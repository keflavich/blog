`|fixed offsets|`_\ `|raw cso ptg|`_\ `|pointing model applied|`_
In L111, the failures noted in the `previous post`_ are specific to
September 2005. By comparing the pointing model images to the "raw cso
pointing" and "no pointing model" (the latter still have FAZO/FZAO
applied, all that has been done to them is aberration/nutation and
precession correction) it appears that the Sep 05 model is simply wrong.
I haven't had time to check on W3/4/5 and L033, but presumably they have
a similar issue. W3/4/5 includes late July 07 and September 06. L033
includes July 05, June 06, and July 07. I will need to generate pointing
plots for September 05 and 06, and probably regenerate June 06. I have
the rest and I think Meredith's models are fine for those dates - they
certainly don't create recognizable errors in the maps.
It is possible that my pointing\_model.pro has some pointing models (the
problematic ones) entered incorrectly. It would be nice to get those
double-checked.
