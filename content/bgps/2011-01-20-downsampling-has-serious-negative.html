Background: Downsampling is performed using Old Pipeline code called<br /><code>process_ncdf</code>.  All BGPS data was downsampled by a factor of 5<br />before mapping because of data size concerns.  I did this 'blindly' (i.e., just<br />accepted that I should) because James said I could.  <br /><br />However, I had previously noted that the pointing files could not be done with<br />downsampled data because the beams 'looked funny' or something along those<br />lines; it may also have been a simple map sampling issue in which not all<br />pixels were filled with a downsampled image.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided to go back and quantify the effects.  The plots below are from the<br />single "pointing-style" observation of OMC1 from 2009.  The units are volts.  'ds1' indicates<br />sampling at 0.02 seconds, 'ds5' indicates sampling every 0.1 seconds.  The scan rate was <br />120"/s.<br /><br /><hr><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TTiWWSS-JVI/AAAAAAAAF24/4m2SFfwWkmA/s1600/omc1_dstest_autocorrfits.png" imageanchor="1" style=""><img align='right' border="0" height="281" width="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TTiWWSS-JVI/AAAAAAAAF24/4m2SFfwWkmA/s400/omc1_dstest_autocorrfits.png" /></a></div>The beam sizes were measured from the autocorrelation maps.  However, because there is structure on many scales<br />in this map, I had to use a rather ad-hoc method to remove the correlated structure.  I fitted a gaussian<br />to the elliptical northwest-southeast structure, removed it, then fitted a gaussian to the remaining circular<br />thing in the center, which is approximately the beam.<br /><br />If I fit the "beam" gaussian with an ellipse, I get:<br />Beamsize 1_1: 36.15,26.23<br />Beamsize 1_5: 48.39,30.21<br /><br />With a circle:<br />Beamsize 1_1: 29.51<br />Beamsize 1_5: 35.31<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TTiWWKeGbJI/AAAAAAAAF2w/jOEmOnDa1hw/s1600/omc1_dstest_images.png" imageanchor="1" style=""><img align='left' border="0" height="307" width="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TTiWWKeGbJI/AAAAAAAAF2w/jOEmOnDa1hw/s400/omc1_dstest_images.png" /></a></div><center> The ds1 and ds5 images compared. </center><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TTiWWlzyWKI/AAAAAAAAF3A/nPCN-C0e3Jo/s1600/omc1_dstest_psds.png" imageanchor="1" style=""><img  align='right' border="0" height="284" width="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TTiWWlzyWKI/AAAAAAAAF3A/nPCN-C0e3Jo/s400/omc1_dstest_psds.png" /></a></div><center> The PSDs of the two images (on identical grids).
