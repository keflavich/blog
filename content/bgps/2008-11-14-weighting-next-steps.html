Idea: 'edge taper' for scans.  The scan start/end usually has higher noise, so it would be good to downweight those regions slightly.  Probably only the first/last 5% of each scan should be linearly downweighted.<br /><br />I'm running a lot of tests on l001 with/without deconvolution, lots of iterations, different pca components.  They'll be done sometime tomorrow.</div>
