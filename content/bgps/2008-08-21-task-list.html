<div class='post'>
For the moment, I'm going to leave the pointing alone.  This leaves us (me) with a very long list of things to do before the data release:<br /><br /><ol><li>Determine ideal iterative mapping strategy for low-flux fields</li><li>Determine ideal iterative mapping strategy for fields with bright sources</li><li>Optimize at least the following:<br /><ol type="a"> <li> scan flatting (polynomial subtraction)</li><li>PCA subtraction</li><li>Pre-PCA sky subtraction (necessary?)</li><li>Deconvolution/No deconvolution<br /></li></ol></li><li>GENERATE MAPS [top priority, but it can't really happen til after the above]<br /></li><li>Assure consistency with catalogs - e.g. Motte, SCUBA, etc.<br /></li><li>Figure out what needs to go into fits header</li><li>Survive semester before comps [lowest priority]</li><li>sleep [oh, right, real lowest priority]</li></ol>Sarcasm helps me survive.  Almost as much as beer.</div>
