This is a direct continuation of what I did yesterday (but only posted today because I forgot to click post).<br /><br />No-deconvolution doesn't work, at least not reliably.  It recovers structures that are too large to be believable.  Perhaps a higher threshold should be required to include signal in the model?  The noise actually looks too high anyway.  Also, the flagging doesn't look great.  Grr.<br /><br />The agreement between the three is somewhat better, down to a 50% increase of reconv over deconv:<br />[deconv, nodeconv, reconv]:<br />BMAJ: 0.00916667  BMIN: 0.00916667  PPBEAM: 23.8028   SUM/PPBEAM: 8.19765<br />Sum: 195.127  Mean: 1.04346  Median: 0.751545  RMS: 0.78342  NPIX: 187<br />BMAJ: 0.00916667  BMIN: 0.00916667  PPBEAM: 23.8028   SUM/PPBEAM: 10.1592<br />Sum: 241.816  Mean: 1.29314  Median: 1.04031  RMS: 0.778854  NPIX: 187<br />BMAJ: 0.00916667  BMIN: 0.00916667  PPBEAM: 23.8028   SUM/PPBEAM: 12.1694<br />Sum: 289.664  Mean: 1.54901  Median: 1.31107  RMS: 0.808915  NPIX: 187<br /><br />But this time there is less indication of negative residuals than previously.<br /><br />I was very confused by negatives being included in the model for nodeconv, then realized it's because of the grow_mask option.<br /><br />sncut = 1 is now default for nodeconv.  I think it makes sense.  <br />(sncut = 1 drops the flux by <10%:<br />BMAJ: 0.00916667  BMIN: 0.00916667  PPBEAM: 23.8028   SUM/PPBEAM: 9.31507<br />Sum: 221.725  Mean: 1.18569  Median: 0.915137  RMS: 0.783316  NPIX: 187)<br /><br />While reconv has produced reasonable results in some cases, a close look at the maps shows that deconv ~ nodeconv << reconv.  There is something wrong with reconv.  It spreads out and increases the flux artificially.  So.... why did it work so damn well for point sources?<br /><br />The new weighting scheme seems to flag a dangerous number of bolos as 'high weight'.  It drops after iteration #1, but not all the way.<br /><br />Need to remember to reprocess all December 2009 data with more flagged bolos</div>
