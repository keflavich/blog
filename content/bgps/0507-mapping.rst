Most of the 0507 pointing source maps seem to have failed. Some of them
look like rotator and position angle problems, others have multiple
copies of sources mapped to different locations. I don't know what's up,
but my first bet would be to change the fiducial array angle. After
that, I'd check on rotang and then, if desperate, see what the PA is
doing.
