This is something of a repeat of yesterday's exercise, but for Herschel
data on larger scales, where filamentation is expected (at different
angles?) on a different scale than the Galactic plane.
First example: L030 500 microns

There is evidently a preferred direction that is correlated down to the
resolution of the map, though the preference is smallest at the smallest
scales. This may simply be a statement that there are more sources along
the galactic plane, though, since there really isn't any particularly
obvious filamentation in the image.

In L59, on the other hand, there is at most a very weak preference
except at the largest scales corresponding to the Galactic Plane. This
is somewhat interesting because there IS obvious filamentation in the
L59 image, but it does not have a preferred direction. Unfortunately, it
is not obvious whether or where filamentation shows up in fourier space
if it does not have a preferred direction. There is no excess at any
spatial scale that I can pick out.
