By comparing the pointing model images to the "raw cso pointing" and "no pointing model" (the latter still have FAZO/FZAO applied, all that has been done to them is aberration/nutation and precession correction) it appears that the Sep 05 model is simply wrong.<br /><br />I haven't had time to check on W3/4/5 and L033, but presumably they have a similar issue.  W3/4/5 includes late July 07 and September 06.  L033 includes July 05, June 06, and July 07.  I will need to generate pointing plots for September 05 and 06, and probably regenerate June 06.  I have the rest and I think Meredith's models are fine for those dates - they certainly don't create recognizable errors in the maps.<br /><br />It is possible that my pointing_model.pro has some pointing models (the problematic ones) entered incorrectly.  It would be nice to get those double-checked.</div>
