<div class='post'>
Done for the day after this (observing tonight)<br /><br />two new procedures:<br />  alignment_offsets_to_ncdf.pro<br />  calcoeffs_to_ncdf.pro<br /><br />they're really easy, very nearly one-liners.  Once they've been used once, you can just use ncdf_varput_scale<br /><br /><br />Modified keyword parameters in do_the_pointing:  offsets will always be applied unless the keyword 'no_offsets' is passed into the code (or the top-level wrapper).  Since offsets default to zero, this should be OK.</div>
