I decided to try to fit the pointing model as a full alt/az or ra/dec dependent thing using mpfitfun and a 12 (or 16) parameter model.  It didn't work very well.<br /><br />I could fit out the alt dependence, then independently fit out the az dependence, and see how that goes.  I think it will work brilliantly.</div>
