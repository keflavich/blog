No progress today. Spent the whole day re-mapping pointing sources and
figuring out which observations ARE pointing sources. Mapping STILL not
done - it takes a long time when there are hundreds of separate
observations. Also, finding some corrupt files and noting them in
/scratch/adam\_work/texts/toolarge.txt . A lot more of that work to be
done.
