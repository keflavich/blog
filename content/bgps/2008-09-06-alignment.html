<div class='post'>
a few items...<br /><ol><li>I requested that pyraf be installed on milkyway.  I don't really want to deal with xgterm/xterm issues when remotely logging in.</li><li>I'm writing up a 'script' on <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/bolocam/pipeline/alignment">http://sites.google.com/site/bolocam/pipeline/alignment</a>.  I believe IRAF is capable of interacting with DS9 even if images are not opened from IRAF, which should allow you to circumvent the 9-frame limit.</li><li>Most of the individual image fields are done now.  There may be a few stragglers, but those are ones that either didn't have an _infile.txt or only had single observations. What do we do about those fields?  They'll be undersampled!</li></ol></div>
