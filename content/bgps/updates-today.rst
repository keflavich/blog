I updated the FITS header writing pieces of the software today, we
should now have:
N\_PCA
ITERNUM
PPBEAM
in all new maps.
I'm mapping all of Cygnus degree-by-degree in RA/Dec and Galactic to try
to measure offsets... possibly offsets as a function of l/b or ra/dec. I
should really be doing this with PPSes, though.
My priority list:

#. find out what's causing bulk offsets
#. beat down noise in my pointing models by rejecting bad sources/points
   [has to be done from campus]
#. test my personal special pointing models
#. make maps!
#. figure out the rest of pointing
