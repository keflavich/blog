0709 11-13 needed to be 83.88 degrees, they're all fixed now.<br /><br />I flagged the l060 070911 maps; I'm not convinced that was weather, there were some fluctuations up to 2400 Jy!  Maybe a cloud would do that though.<br /><br />Problems in the latest run: <br />l359 - missing files?<br />Reading files from /scratch/sliced/INFILES/l359_infile.txt<br />FIELD v0.7_l359 BEGUN at Fri Jan 16 20:11:34 2009<br />MRDFITS: File access error<br />% HEULER: ERROR - First parameter must be a FITS header or astrometry<br />          structure<br />l012 - missing files?<br />% READFITS:  ERROR - Unable to locate file<br />            /scratch/adam_work/l012/060614_o10_raw_ds5.nc_indiv13pca_map01.fi<br />            ts</div>
