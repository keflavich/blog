Made a little code to check out convergence, but frankly it's pretty easy to just build a mapcube and plot lines in the iteration axis.  The code is in bgps_pipeline/postproc/compareiters.pro, and it is not a single program.<br /><br />Comparing deconvolution to no deconvolution, deconvolution is a lot better.  Without it, there are much more substantial negative regions.  In the GC, my test region, the noise-dominated areas were about the same, though the no-deconvolve map had a little bit more large scale structure.  The signal-dominated regions were very nearly uniformly brighter.  The deconvolved map was ~3 Jy brighter in SGR B2, or 4%.</div>
