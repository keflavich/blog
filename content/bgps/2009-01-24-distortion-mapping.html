Between sign errors, failures to fit, and.... I really don't know WHAT was going on, I finally figured out how to get the cursed distortion mapping to work.  I still haven't even started testing, unfortunately.<br /><br />I don't know why I can fit the way the OP did, fitting R and Theta, and I apparently can't fit x,y.  It's frustrating.</div>
