For the moment, I'm going to leave the pointing alone. This leaves us
(me) with a very long list of things to do before the data release:

#. Determine ideal iterative mapping strategy for low-flux fields
#. Determine ideal iterative mapping strategy for fields with bright
   sources
#. Optimize at least the following:

   #. scan flatting (polynomial subtraction)
   #. PCA subtraction
   #. Pre-PCA sky subtraction (necessary?)
   #. Deconvolution/No deconvolution

#. GENERATE MAPS [top priority, but it can't really happen til after the
   above]
#. Assure consistency with catalogs - e.g. Motte, SCUBA, etc.
#. Figure out what needs to go into fits header
#. Survive semester before comps [lowest priority]
#. sleep [oh, right, real lowest priority]

Sarcasm helps me survive. Almost as much as beer.
