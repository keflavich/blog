-  Re-doing December 2010 calibration (remember to check & compare AFGL
   4029)
-  Mapping L351 with deconv, reconv, nodeconv

ARGH something is wrong with l351 pointing! Is the pointing model
broken? What HAPPENED?!
OK, on to 4/8/2011 stuff:
I've done more work on the Memo from a few weeks ago, and now have a
concrete recommendation that we do some more observing in 2011. Why I
torture myself so, I do not know....
Examination of the 2009 tests shows that reconv is by far the superior
approach for pointing observations as previously noted. Since reconv
doesn't look bad, but definitely not best, for science, it might be the
compromise we have to make. nodeconv completely fails for ds5 data, but
the ds5 data in general are abominable. They drop by 15-20% compared to
ds1 for Mars. The problem with nodeconv appears to be extremely high
noise maps.
