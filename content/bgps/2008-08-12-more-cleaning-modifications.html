<div class='post'>
I had removed sigmadeglitch from deline, now it's permanently gone.  I think it might be worth exploring re-inserting sigmadeglitch somewhere.<br /><br />My higher-order polynomial fit is creating deeper bowls around sources, so that's a big problem, but if I use a lower order I get the bad streaks.  What's the best way to deal with this?  I'm thinking perhaps only doing the polysub on the second iteration (i.e. after a source model has been subtracted).<br /><br />Delining runs into some issues now, though, because not all frequencies are sampled (?).</div>
