The Y axis shows the Input flux (green) and the Filtered flux (blue/cyan/purple) with a few different large-scale filters.  The red line is the 1-1 line.  Obviously, bolocat doesn't recover everything that was there - we removed a lot of flux, so recovery fractions are in the few % range.  However, bolocat does a much better job than the simple filter at recovering positive fluxes.  Therefore, the filter function still isn't good enough.</div>
