<div class='post'>
Things that have been changed in the past 24 hours that are very significant:<br /><ol><li>In apply_pointing_model, the signs of FAZO and FZAO have been swapped.  I BELIEVE this is correct but somehow things aren't working out still.</li><li>In do_the_pointing I have changed from "eq2hor" and "hor2eq" to "my_eq2hor" and "my_hor2eq".  These implement two major changes:<br /><ol type="a"><li> The LST is passed as a parameter rather than calculated within the ASTROLIB code<br /></li><li> The conversion is calculated with BOTH hadec2altaz and getaltaz (and similar for the opposite transformation) and compared for error checking purposes.  If they differ by more than one arcsecond, the code will spit out an error message and use getaltaz. </li></ol><br /></li></ol></div>
