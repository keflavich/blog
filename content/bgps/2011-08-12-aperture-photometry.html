<div class='post'>

<br />So the code to add point sources to the maps and perform basic aperture photometry has started working to the point where I can share some results.<div>
<br /></div><div>For maps with no underlying sky structure, only point sources, recovery is very nearly perfect, with PearsonR coefficients essentially equal to 1 until the peak amplitude of the point sources drops below 2.0 (and even then they only drop to ~0.997)</div><div>Below is a sample of the difference residual of output-input flux vs input flux for 40", 80" and 120" apertures</div><div>

<br /></div><div><div>Note that for the blank maps, these are taken from simulations using a power law distribution of point sources from 0.1 to 2.0 Jy in magnitude (if we allow the range to extend above 2.0 Jy, the recoveries become even more closely correlated.</div></div></div><div>
<br /></div><div>As for simulations with background sky structure we see similar patterns for the most part, however a few interesting pieces appear:</div><div>For the 4 different source ranges I ran, the 80" aperture had the highest pearson r coefficient across all simulations. Generally sitting around 0.95 with the 40" and 120" apertures floating from 0.75-0.9. This may be a fluke, however, I need to run more simulations to see if this is reproducible with other seeds.</div><div>
<br /></div><div>Also, in the difference residuals we can clearly see an underrecovery of flux as input flux increases, which we should probably work to quantify, as seen by this example:</div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X4lP1Pl4PLg/TkXka4eio7I/AAAAAAAAABs/RCKTuX14PD8/s1600/exp13_ds2_astrosky_arrang45_atmotest_amp2.0E%252B01_sky00_seed00_peak001.00_smooth_srcpeakalpha002.00source_range_00.1_02.0_wptsrcptsrc_brightness_diffresid.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X4lP1Pl4PLg/TkXka4eio7I/AAAAAAAAABs/RCKTuX14PD8/s320/exp13_ds2_astrosky_arrang45_atmotest_amp2.0E%252B01_sky00_seed00_peak001.00_smooth_srcpeakalpha002.00source_range_00.1_02.0_wptsrcptsrc_brightness_diffresid.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5640165258839630770" /></a><div>
