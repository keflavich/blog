Finished mapping what I think are all of the pointing sources. However,
the RMS of the centroids has not gone down. Now I need to go through
each individual source and image and try to get rid of the baddies.
There are presumably some sources with bulk offsets that can be removed
to improve the fits. I just have to find them.
