The comparisons I mentioned in the previous post are sort of done.&nbsp; They are pretty suggestive of a solution to the "flux recovery problem" we think must be true.&nbsp; However, even if it is a solution, it doesn't really solve the problem completely.<br /><br />It looks like v1.0 should be scaled up by a factor of 1.3-1.4 (not 1.5).&nbsp; v2.0 is consistent with the PPS sources to within 5%, and might even be slightly too high.<br /><br />The comparison was done by taking the flux in a 60" radius aperture (equivalent to bolocat 120" diameter apertures) and subtracting off the background measured in a 120" radius annulus around the source.&nbsp; Without the background subtraction, these numbers would look very different: in the science fields, most of the sources sit on an extended background.&nbsp; Even though the "background flux" isn't recovered in the PPS fields, it should contribute to the source background because it is involved in the atmosphere subtraction (it's sort of "already subtracted" so you have to subtract from the science fields).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TB-rPT7MLdI/AAAAAAAAFws/7oWTt3FOF-M/s1600/BGPS_correction_factors.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TB-rPT7MLdI/AAAAAAAAFws/7oWTt3FOF-M/s320/BGPS_correction_factors.png" /></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TB-rQId8G_I/AAAAAAAAFw0/NUJKQO_5zI4/s1600/BGPS_correction_factor_histograms.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TB-rQId8G_I/AAAAAAAAFw0/NUJKQO_5zI4/s320/BGPS_correction_factor_histograms.png" /></a></div>Next step: direct comparison between v1.0 and v2.0.&nbsp; Pixel by pixel, aperture, and powerspectrum</div>
