`Cat and Girl`_ is a webcomic probably best described as being
subversive.
`Today's comic`_ reveals that my role is to perpetuate a system. It's
always nice to analyze your workplace and world on a deeper level. I am
perpetuating evil, but the `alternatives`_ are `scary`_.
Also, just to make sure there's a tie back to beer, `Goats`_ has a
`litany for beer`_.
