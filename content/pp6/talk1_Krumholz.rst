Abstract
--------
Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are the primary reservoirs of cold, star-forming
molecular gas in the Milky Way and similar galaxies, and thus any understanding
of star formation must encompass a model for GMC formation, evolution, and
destruction. These models are necessarily constrained by measurements of
interstellar molecular and atomic gas, and the emergent, newborn stars. Both
observations and theory have undergone great advances in recent years, the
latter driven largely by improved numerical simulations, and the former by the
advent of large-scale surveys with new telescopes and instruments. This chapter
reviews the current state of the field. 

Content
-------

Galactic Scale
##############

 * HI column density "hits a wall"
 * molecular gas correlated with SF
 * "depletion time" ~ 2 Gyr
 * power law index of molecular clouds: -1.5 to -2 -> most mass in big clouds

   * only in gas-rich regions
   * steeper in outer regions of galaxies: -2 to -2.5

 * typical mean surface density 100 Msun/pc^2
 * PDF of surface densities "lognormal" with powerlaw tail

Theory
######

Virial Parameter: :math:`\sigma_v = (\alpha_G \pi G \Sigma R / 5)^{1/2}`

:math:`\alpha_G = -2 T/ W`

 * :math:`\alpha_G = 2` -> free-fall collapse
 * 3 options: pressure confinement, virial balance, or free-fall collapse
 * Most velocity dispersion on largest scale
 * median :math:`\alpha_G \sim 0.1`

:math:`M/M_{crit} = \frac{M}{\phi/(4\pi G)^{1/2}} \approx 2`

 * B-fields not strong enough to support against gravity in mol. clds (Crutcher)

Lifetime of Molecular Clouds
############################

Spatial distribution + galactic dynamics.

Method 1: compare dynamics to distribution
 * Formed in the arms and survive passage between arms? (implies lifetime ~100 Myr)

Method 2: compare star cluster ages to spatial cloud distribution
 * lifetimes closer to 30 Myr

Method 3: look at T Tau vs post T Tau (Hartmann 2009)
 * 3 Myr for Taurus

Why difference?

 * size matters
 * should compare lifetimes to cloud dynamical times

:math:`t_{ff} = \left(\frac{3\pi}{32 G \rho}\right)^{3/2}`

Efficiency
##########
The rate at which gas converts into stars.

:math:`\epsilon_{ff} = SFR / (M_{gas}/t_{ff}) \sim 0.01`

 * if pure free-fall, :math:`\epsilon_{ff} = 1`
 * Low star formation rate
 * Lifetime << 100 :math:`t_{ff}`
 * Lifetime * efficiency < 1, so low overall star formation efficiency

Metallicity
###########
Break between HI and CO:
 * 10 Msun in Galaxy, local spirals
 * 50 Msun in SMC

How do Molecular Clouds form?
-----------------------------
"Stories", not conclusions

Converging Flows
################
 
 * Collision -> cooling
 * vazquez-semadeni et al
 * "local turbulence" triggers collision of warm HI
 * Can't make big clouds: limited to mean surface density * scale height?  [needs more]

Cloud Collision in Spiral Arms
##############################

 * Spiral arms are convergence points
 * Collisions unlikely in most of galaxy
 * orbits crowd in arms: collisions more likely
 * mechanism probably can't work in flocculent galaxies
 * explains counter-orbiting GMCs [are these really a common feature?]

Gravitational Magneto-Jeans (Kim & Ostriker 2006)
#################################################

 * Toomre Q instability at Q < 1.5
 * makes 10^7-10^8 Msun clouds; smaller ones must fragment
 * produces low spin clouds.  Mol. Clds apparently have much less angular
   momentum than expected
 * easily explains "beads on a string" morphology [why?]

Parker + Thermal instability (Mouschovias et al 2005)
#####################################################

 * Buoyancy draws B-fields out of plane
 * may not work with turbulence

Chemistry: Forming H2 and CO
############################

 * H2 dominance begins at ~10 Msun/pc^2
 * Glover and Clark: Is the molecular transition a necessary prerequisite to
   star formation?
 * Extincting FUV allows cooling, H2 formation

Evolution of Molecular Clouds
-----------------------------

Morphology?

 * Highest intensity offset from highest column (DR21; Schneider 2001)
 * MHD collapse (Hennebelle) vs. pure turbulence (Federrath)
 
Non-thermal motions in GMCs:

 * Molecular clouds are invariably turbulent
 * Reynolds number ~10^9
 * Turbulence decays: Why sigma so large?

   * Global grav collapse?
   * Internal energy injection?
   * External driving?

External driving:
 
 * Accretion energy
 * Large-scale galactic shear
 * Requires feedback to get star formation right

Internal driving:

 * Gritschneder: ejected clumps stirring up
 * Someone else: B-fields distorted by ionization, store energy

Mol Cld Disruption
##################

 * Dont' survive, must be disrupted....

Why SF rate low?
----------------

 * feedback
 * or turbulence

Disruption Scenarios
####################

 * ionization can disrupt up to 10^5, may not work above that mass
 * turbulence slows down SF
 * turbulence must be maintained

Scales
######

 * "Normal" from 10-100 msun/pc^2 (all clouds are the same; cloud counting)
 * extreme above 100 msun/pc^2 (densities in mol clds very high; mean surface density of galaxy matches individual clouds)
 * "all hell break loose" < 10 msun/pc^2

Future
------

 * Obs: big surveys, better data
 * Thry: Need to combine large and small scales

Questions
---------

 * Q: Correlation with CO, H2... have there been correlations with others?
 * A: Yes, very well correlated with HCN, but no maps

 * Q Tan: Tasker showed that GMC collisions can happen on short timescales...????
 * Q Tan: B-fields relatively weak by "factor of 2, but don't believe to factor of
    2".  Could B-fields still be important?
 * A: I know about your work with Tasker.  Requires high surface density.  Can't
    work in, e.g., M33.
 * A: B-fields.  If only a few measurements, fine.  But with so much data...
     (systematic??)

 * Comment: Reconciling ages in LMC vs local.  Function of measurement method:
   LMC, use OB stars outside.  Inside clouds, locally, don't use OB.  Ages may be
   biased...
 * A: What do you call a cloud?  Clump?

 * Q: Should we stop talking about virial equilibrium, start talking about
    equipartition?
 * A: They may be in equilibrium.  No "true" equilibrium, but a "statistical
    equilibrium".  Equipartition is uninteresting since the energies are
    automatically equal.
