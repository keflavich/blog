The formation of stars and planets are connected through disks. Our theoretical
understanding of disk formation has undergone drastic changes since PPV, and we
are on the brink of an ALMA-enabled revolution in disk observation. Disk
formation - once thought to be a trivial consequence of the conservation of
angular momentum - is far more subtle in magnetized gas. In this case, the
rotation can be strongly magnetically braked. Indeed, both analytic arguments
and numerical simulations have shown that disk formation is suppressed in the
strict ideal MHD limit for the observed level of core magnetization, at least
for idealized, laminar, axisymmetric cores with ordered magnetic fields. In the
theoretical literature, this "catastrophic" magnetic braking characterizes the
situation wherein the angular momentum of an idealized collapsing core is
nearly completely removed by magnetic braking close to the central object. We
will review what is known about this "magnetic braking catastrophe", possible
ways to resolve it, and the current status of early disk observations. Possible
resolutions include non-ideal MHD effects (ambipolar diffusion, Ohmic
dissipation and Hall effect), magnetic interchange instability in the inner
part of protostellar accretion flow, turbulence, misalignment between the
magnetic field and rotation axis, and depletion of the slowly rotating envelope
by outflow stripping or accretion. We will assess the pros and cons of each of
these proposed resolutions and put them into an over-arching physical context.
Outflows are also intimately linked to disk formation; they are a natural
product of magnetic fields and rotation and are important signposts of star
formation. We review new developments on early outflow generation since PPV.
The properties of early disks and outflows are a key component of planet
formation in its early stages and we will review these major connections. 


Outline
-------

 * Difficulty of forming disks in ideal MHD limit
 * Can non-ideal save disk in 2D?
 * Can 3D effects do it?
 * How can you form rotationally supported disks?

Dimensionless number: 
:math:`\lambda = \frac{(M/\phi)}{1/(2\pi G^{1/2})}`

Crutcher: B-fields below critical value

B-field energy > rotational energy

Strict ideal MHD: flux always traces stars

"Magnetic Braking Catastrophe" - flow dynamics near split monopole

[stopped taking notes early - I didn't know there was any problem associated with disk formation difficulties before this talk...]

Questions
---------
 * Q: Disagree.  Dead zone due to high density.  Easy to form disk there.
 * Q: Alyssa? Great that there are sophisticated arguments... I want more effort on predictions of what would be observed
 * A: need to find twist of field?
 * Q: Mac Low - cautionary note.  Scale of turbulence very deep.
 * Q: Tobin - Is it suspicious that large, resolved disks have B-field perp to
   outflow direction?  Maybe misaligned fields allow formation of large disks.
   In other model, do you have enough mass left to form binary stars, etc?
 * A: On core scale, field parallel to outflow
 * Q: Megeath - How long do the simulations run?  What is the angular momentum
   distribution?   How does it depend on envelope.
 * Q: Predictions are unclear...
