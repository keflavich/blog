We review and discuss the latest observational scenario globally emerging from
the latest generation of continuum and spectroscopic global-scale surveys of
the mid-plane of the Galaxy from infrared to radio wavelengths, in terms of
cloud formation and evolution, star and clump formation rate and efficiency
throughout the Galaxy, evidence for density thresholds for the formation of
protocluster-forming clumps, as well as the role of large-scale filamentary
structures in channeling diffuse ISM into gravitationally bound clumps. The new
view of the Milky Way thus assembled will be discussed in the context of
competing theoretical frameworks distinguishing between "slow" and "fast"
formation, outlining some of the challenges that this body of evidence poses to
a variety of theoretical scenarios for large-scale star formation. We will
review the most recent methods and evolutionary indicators used to classify the
star formation activity in molecular clumps, comparing the different possible
derivations of the local SFR and discussing its variation as a function of
Galactocentric radius. The order-of-magnitude increase in the number of sources
(mostly clumps) that are revealed in state-of-the-art infrared and
submillimeter Galaxy-wide surveys make such studies possible with an
unprecedented statistical significance. We will also review the present status
of our understanding of the Galaxy as a global star formation engine in the
context of similar studies in extragalactic systems, evaluating how the data on
our own Galaxy compare with the proposed global star formation laws that relate
properties of the interstellar medium to the star formation rate. 

Intro
-----
Link the MW to high redshift.

"Galactic Ecology"

 * Efficiency "<15%"
 * Feedback -> "superbubbles"
 * "oops"
 * solar circle Z-scale oscillation 80 Myr
 * Epicyclic period 170 Myr [what is this orbital scale?)
 * orbital timescale 220 Myr

Large scale view:

 * Sco-Cen HI supershell (1973 A&AS)
 * Rho Oph filament swept up by Sco-Cen bubble?
 * Sco-Cen has HI, not H-alpha
 * Alpha-Persei blew a bubble for Cosmologists

Orion CO

 * Integral shaped filament
 * Velocity jump occurs at cluster
 * Vazquez-Semadeni 2008 colliding cloud resembles ISF

BGPS -> ATLASGAL -> Herschel

And now let's start the talk...

HiGal
-----
HiGal 360 in OT2

W3/W4/W5

 * W3 OB cluster
 * W4 cometary cloud
 * W5 (name drop)

NGC 7538
 * filament full of H2 outflows

W43
 * 50 Orions
 * 3 Myr old
 * older subgroup to the south

Goodman's "we're out of the plane"
 * Nearby spiral arms below the "plane"

W51 - Spitzer
 * massive clusters

Back to M16, M17
 * M17
 * M17swex
 * red square

Nessie (Jackson)
 * extended Nessie from Alyssa Goodman

Carina Nebula
 * eta car
 * Trumpler 16

NGC 3603

Filament Formation
------------------
"Zeldovich Pancakes" - tend to collapse along minor axes first
Converging flows
"shadowing" HII regions -> cometary filament = tail
Vazquez-Semadeni colliding flows movie

Filaments in HiGal
 * Schisano 2013 - Herschel filaments is continuously distributed (no threshold effect)
 * Mass per unit length increases with amt of star formation

Distances
---------
 * Russeil "Bootstrap Morphology"
 * BeSSeL parallax
 * Distance PDF (Ellsworth-Bowers) 
   * showed example DPDFs
   * Shirley & Schlingman HCO+/N2H+ velocities
   * description of the algorithm
 * Bessel points colored by arm
 
Battersby 2011 "Maybe I'll skip this"
 * How does dust vary with SF signature

Pestalozzi face-on view of the galaxy
 * mass-luminosity plot

Finish with the CMZ
 * 80% of gas at n>10^4 in CMZ
 * Bania's clump - strange kinematics
 * Orbits in a bar
 * Inner Lindblad resonance?
 * compare our CMZ to NGC 1097
 * Dust at l > 0, 24um sources at l < 0

Molinari Ring
 * Vertical oscillation timescale twice orbit timescale
 * Sgr B2 has high proper motion in the plane
 * Battersby temperature / column maps
 * several 10^7 msun of non-star-forming gas

Back to CMZ:
 * Free-free emission
 * CND / circumnuclear ring
 * Sgr A* has no influence on the Galaxy
 * star formation starves Sgr A*

Plug for CCAT, ALMA

Storm the Castle!

Questions
---------
 * Q: Mordecai - seen fragmentation starvation in massive star formation as well
 * A: Yep.  Also, Phil knows disk around black hole is like a disk around a protostar

 * Q: Philippe - Threshold issue.  No threshold in Hi-Gal data.  
 * A: missed it, someone walked in front of me
 * A: Molinari - Different physics, different scales?

 * Q: Sergei - Fermi bubble feature.  Attributed to star formation.  In other
   galaxies... we've seen one other analog?  More than enough energy in a Sgr
   A* outburst.
 * A: Should ask how we distinguish AGN-driven vs. star-formation-driven flows.
   AGN should be low-mass, light, relativistic launch.  Star formation blows
   out big HI bubbles (high-mass).
 * Same guy: Cosmologists say AGN can blow up whole galaxies

 * Q Hans: Sequential star formation, triggered SF... are we more informed
   about triggering now than before?
 * A: Triggering is a great model, but observationally indistinguishable.  Only
   way to know is precision kinematics.  Need GAIA.
   It happens, but can't be proved.
