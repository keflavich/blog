A brief commentary on a recent article `Next Generation Astronomy`_:
I'm probably one of the folks who will be working on making that future
happen, in the sense of being the intermediary between the end-user and
the instrumentalist. Scientists are still needed to build instruments,
but those who build the instruments don't necessarily have the time or
expertise to build the software pipelines that generate high-quality
data.
At the same time, the `STARLINK`_ folks do a much better job than I do,
and I already spend about half of my time comparing different archival
data sets... so I think his crystal ball is overall very accurate.
