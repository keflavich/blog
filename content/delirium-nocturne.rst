Delirium Tremens is a tasty beer itself, I think. I'm drinking Delirium
Nocturne right now. It has a cool (opaque!) bottle, plus a pink elephant
on the label. At 8.5% it's pretty strong, but very drinkable with no
taste of alcohol. It's definitely my favorite Belgian brown now. It
still has that wheat-soy-sauce taste to it, but very weakly. It poured
with ridiculous head - I could not control it. Overall, great beer,
worth the ridiculous price I paid for it, whatever that was.
