I realized I don't have a gardening category and I should.
I have eaten 2 garden tomatoes. There have been a total of 3 that
ripened. There is a fourth on the vine. There are ~40-50 big green ones
being big and green.
I ate basil in my pasta sauce yesterday. I need to buy some pine nuts.
But I'm not pining for nuts.
Next year, start growing in March!
