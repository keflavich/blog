We went 2-1 in the tournament, losing the final in a windy game on
universe point, 15-14. We won the first game 13-5 or 13-6, and the
second by a similarly wide margin. I think I scored 15-20 points on the
day and threw an additional few. 2-3 drops and 3-4 throwaways to balance
that out. Pretty good on the whole for what was probably my last
ultimate of the season.
Of course, that made me very exhausted for the review session this
evening. Oh well, I think it worked out. I need to remember to come up
with (and post!) a clear explanation of why you can use that silly
little triangle to come up with the translation between angle on the sky
and image size.
