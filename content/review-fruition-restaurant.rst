I ate at `Fruition restaurant`_ last night with the family. They serve
`haute cuisine`_. I had the beef coulotte. It was pretty tasty, but
overall a bit too creamy for my taste. The wine had a hint of cherry
flavor to it. The dinner was pretty good, but overall a little
disappointing for the price. The French press coffee was a bit much as I
would have preferred a small cup of cappuccino. I wouldn't object to
going back when they switch to a new seasonal menu, but I'm not going
out of my way.
