I wrote about half of this paper and did the majority of the work
described, including writing the `data pipeline`_ and reducing all of
the data. However, there was a good deal of work done on the project
before I showed up on the scene.
The paper describes the methods by which we reduced the Bolocam
observations of the Northern Galactic Plane and the tests we ran to
determine how well we recovered the "true" sky structure.
