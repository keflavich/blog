        <div class="Abstract">We present observations of near-infrared 2.12 mum
        molecular hydrogen outflows emerging from 1.1 mm dust continuum clumps
        in the North America and Pelican Nebula (NAP) complex selected from the
        Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). Hundreds of individual shocks
        powered by over 50 outflows from young stars are identified, indicating
        that the dusty molecular clumps surrounding the NGC 7000/IC 5070/W80 H
        II region are among the most active sites of ongoing star formation in
        the solar vicinity. A spectacular X-shaped outflow, MHO 3400, emerges
        from a young star system embedded in a dense clump more than a parsec
        from the ionization front associated with the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070).
        Suspected to be a binary, the source drives a pair of outflows with
        orientations differing by 80$\,^{\circ}$. Each flow exhibits S-shaped
        symmetry and multiple shocks indicating a pulsed and precessing jet.
        The "Gulf of Mexico," located south of the North America Nebula (NGC
        7000), contains a dense cluster of molecular hydrogen objects (MHOs),
        Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, and over 300 young stellar objects (YSOs),
        indicating a recent burst of star formation. The largest outflow
        detected thus far in the North America and Pelican Nebula complex, the
        1.6 parsec long MHO 3417 flow, emerges from a 500 M &sun; BGPS clump
        and may be powered by a forming massive star. Several prominent
        outflows such as MHO 3427 appear to be powered by highly embedded YSOs
        only visible at lambda > 70 mum. An "activity index" formed by dividing
        the number of shocks by the mass of the cloud containing their source
        stars is used to estimate the relative evolutionary states of Bolocam
        clumps. Outflows can be used as indicators of the evolutionary state of
        clumps detected in millimeter and submillimeter dust continuum
        surveys.</div>

        <div class="Abstract">ALMA HCO+ observations of the infrared dark cloud G0.253+0.016 located in the central molecular zone of the Galaxy are presented. The 89 GHz emission is area-filling, optically thick, and sub-thermally excited. Two types of filaments are seen in absorption against the HCO+ emission. Broad-line absorption filaments (BLAs) have widths of less than a few arcseconds (0.07-0.14 pc), lengths of 30-50 arcsec (1.2-1.8 pc), and absorption profiles extending over a velocity range larger than 20 km s-1. The BLAs are nearly parallel to the nearby G0.18 non-thermal filaments and may trace HCO+ molecules gyrating about highly ordered magnetic fields located in front of G0.253+0.016 or edge-on sheets formed behind supersonic shocks propagating orthogonal to our line of sight in the foreground. Narrow-line absorption filaments (NLAs) have line widths less than 20 km s-1. Some NLAs are also seen in absorption in other species with high optical depth, such as HCN, and occasionally in emission where the background is faint. The NLAs, which also trace low-density, sub-thermally excited HCO+ molecules, are mostly seen on the blueshifted side of the emission from G0.253+0.016. If associated with the surface of G0.253+0.016, the kinematics of the NLAs indicate that the cloud surface is expanding. The decompression of entrained, milli-Gauss magnetic fields may be responsible for the re-expansion of the surface layers of G0.253+0.016 as it recedes from the Galactic center following a close encounter with Sgr A.</div>

        <div class="Abstract">We present new 2 cm and 6 cm maps of H2CO, radio recombination lines, and the radio continuum in the W51 star forming complex acquired with Arecibo and the Green Bank Telescope at ~50" resolution. We use H2CO absorption to determine the relative line-of-sight positions of molecular and ionized gas. We measure gas densities using the H2CO densitometer, including continuous measurements of the dense gas mass fraction (DGMF) over the range 10^4 cm^-3 < n(H_2) < 10^6 cm^-3- this is the first time a dense gas mass fraction has been measured over a range of densities with a single data set. The DGMF in W51A is high,f >~70% above n>10^4 cm^-3, while it is low, f<20%, in W51 B. We did not detect any H2CO emission throughout the W51 GMC; all gas dense enough to emit under normal conditions is in front of bright continuum sources and therefore is seen in absorption instead. The data set has been made public at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/26818. Conclusions. (1) The dense gas fraction in the W51 A and B clouds shows that W51 A will continue to form stars vigorously, while star formation has mostly ended in W51 B. The lack of dense, star-forming gas around W51 C indicates that collect-and-collapse is not acting or is inefficient in W51. (2) Ongoing high-mass star formation is correlated with n ~ 1x10^5 cm-3 gas. Gas with n > 10^4 cm-3 is weakly correlated with low and moderate mass star formation, but does not strongly correlate with high-mass star formation. (3) The nondetection of H2CO emission implies that the emission detected in other galaxies, e.g. Arp 220, comes from high-density gas that is not directly affiliated with already-formed massive stars. Either the non-star-forming ISM of these galaxies is very dense, implying the star formation density threshold is higher, or H ii regions have their emission suppressed.</div>

        <div class="Abstract">We present new NH3 (1, 1), (2, 2), and (4, 4) observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array compiled with work in the literature to explore the range of conditions observed in young, massive star-forming regions. To sample the effects of evolution independent from those of distance/resolution, abundance, and large-scale environment, we compare clumps in different evolutionary stages within a single infrared dark cloud (IRDC), G32.02+0.06. We find that the early stages of clustered star formation are characterized by dense, parsec-scale filamentary structures interspersed with complexes of dense cores (<0.1 pc cores clustered in complexes separated by ~1 pc) with masses from about 10 to 100 M &sun;. The most quiescent core is the most extended while the star forming cores are denser and more compact, showing very similar column density structure before and shortly after the onset of massive star formation, with peak surface densities Sigma >~ 1 g cm-2. Quiescent cores and filaments show smoothly varying temperatures from 10 to 20 K, rising to over 40 K in star-forming cores. We calculate virial parameters for 16 cores and find that the level of support provided by turbulence is generally insufficient to support them against gravitational collapse (langalphavirrang ~ 0.6). The star-forming filaments show smooth velocity fields, punctuated by discontinuities at the sites of active star formation. We discuss the massive molecular filament (M ~ 105 M &sun;, length >60 pc) hosting the IRDC, hypothesizing that it may have been shaped by previous generations of massive stars.</div>

        <div class="Abstract">We explore the relationship between gas and dust in a massive star-forming region by comparing the physical properties derived from each. We compare the temperatures and column densities in a massive star-forming Infrared Dark Cloud (G32.02+0.05), which shows a range of evolutionary states, from quiescent to active. The gas properties were derived using radiative transfer modeling of the (1,1), (2,2), and (4,4) transitions of NH3 on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, while the dust temperatures and column densities were calculated using cirrus-subtracted, modified blackbody fits to Herschel data. We compare the derived column densities to calculate an NH3 abundance, chi_{NH_{3}} = 4.6 × 10-8. In the coldest star-forming region, we find that the measured dust temperatures are lower than the measured gas temperatures (mean and standard deviations T dust, avg ~ 11.6 $\pm$ 0.2 K versus T gas, avg ~ 15.2 $\pm$ 1.5 K), which may indicate that the gas and dust are not well-coupled in the youngest regions (~0.5 Myr) or that these observations probe a regime where the dust and/or gas temperature measurements are unreliable. Finally, we calculate millimeter fluxes based on the temperatures and column densities derived from NH3, which suggest that millimeter dust continuum observations of massive star-forming regions, such as the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey or ATLASGAL, can probe hot cores, cold cores, and the dense gas lanes from which they form, and are generally not dominated by the hottest core.</div>
