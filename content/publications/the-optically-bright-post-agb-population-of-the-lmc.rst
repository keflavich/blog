A catalog of post-AGB stars in the LMC, useful in particular because
they are at a common distance. Post-AGB stars are quite luminous (> 1000
L\ :sub:`O` usually), so easily detected in the LMC.

My contribution to this work was years ago; I worked on the `SAGE`_
project for a few months at the University of Denver with `Toshiya
Ueta`_. I generated a catalog of post-AGB objects and an online catalog
with automatic SED plotter. It was a pretty neat project, but I left
before I was able to convince others that my catalog was definitive;
nonetheless it was eventually used in this publication. As an aside,
that was my first foray into data languages, and I ended up using the
`Perl Data Language`_ long before I learned of python and before I got a
free IDL license.
