A mm and near-IR study of the IRAS 05358+3543 system. Recently (2011),
it has become clear that "protocluster" is unlikely to be the right
label for IRAS 05358+3543. "proto-association" might be more accurate.
Perhaps the most interesting result of this paper is the discovery that
the central source is likely to be a 400-AU binary with two massive (>8
msun) stars at different evolutionary stages. It is just barely in
ALMA's range...
