My primary contribution to this work was reducing the data from which
catalogs were derived. As part of this process, I also made the noise
maps that were part of the Bolocat process and did some of the by-eye
verification work.
Bolocat extracted >8000 sources from the BGPS using a watershed
decomposition method. Most of these sources have now been observed with
the HHT in HCO+ and N2H+ to determine their velocity and kinematic
distance.
