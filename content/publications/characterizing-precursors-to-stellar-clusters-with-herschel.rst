The paper includes a careful characterization of the properties of both
dense and diffuse regions within the two Hi-Gal Science Demonstration
Phase fields (l=30 and l=59). It demonstrated that star formation
tracers are more common at higher temperatures, and that IRDCs exist on
both the near and far side of the galaxy, where the difference between
near and far is around 5-7 kpc.

I helped develop the iterative background subtraction method and
contributed to the discussion and conclusions; most of the work was
Cara's but my experience with iterative flux estimation from the `BGPS
pipeline`_ proved useful.
