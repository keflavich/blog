Saw Hancock on Tuesday. Basically, as hinted at by friends, didn't live
up to expectations. The funny quit early, and they tried to insert some
'dark superhero movie' into it in the second half. From the ads, and the
presence of Jason Bateman & his character, this was inappropriate. Not a
great movie, stick to the Dark Knight.
