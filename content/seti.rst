I read a `paper on ArXiv`_ today about SETI, and talked to `Jeremy
Darling`_ about water masers. This got me thinking: the best way to
signal your presence to the universe as an intelligent civilization is
to take advantage of natural amplification. So, say, you go find a big
cloud of water molecules in the right state to start masing, and blast
them with some of the right frequency radio emission: you get a strongly
enhanced isotropic emitter. Maybe SETI should look for those, then
search for nearby coherent sources....
EDIT: Isotropic? No.
