Coffee at 7 pm usually isn't a problem...    

 1. Dendrogram analysis of turbulent simulations.  What do the structures look
    like?  Mostly for visualization in a talk, but perhaps the start of a paper.
    Are the high-density substructures too small to collapse?  Too hot?
 2. A deep GBT+AO observation of the center of the G49 40km/s cloud.  Can we
    perform the same measurement as I did originally against a uniform
    backlight?  Will that provide new information
 3. Corollary to 2: In simulations, what effect does a varying size and
    brightness backlight have on the inferred density?
 4. Measure the distance to the G49 cloud with NIR extinction.  Keep working
    with Jonathan Foster on that...
 5. Test the Cepheid / RR Lyrae distance method on the G49 cloud.  It's close
    enough that the targets should be bright.  Start off with 1-hour pilot
    (DD?) on the most distant star with a "guaranteed" CO detection, then
    propose a longer project to begin using the bisector approach to determine
    its true distance.
 6. Eta Car ALMA.  Basically, same thing, but now invoke the SN 1987A CO
    detection.  Eta is the closer laboratory, and it must have similar shock
    physics...
 7. H3+ in the CMZ with Juergen.  Talk to Tom Geballe about H3+ and CO
    absorption.  Is it possible to measure CO absorption to red giants?
