Mordecai Mac-Low: Stellar Feedback
----------------------------------
SNe explode away from their birthplaces
 * ionizing radiation contains 10x more energy than SNe
 * outer disk SF inadequate to explain kinetic energy observed
 * "almost constant velocity dispersion in HI in local universe"
 * ionization escape determined within 1pc (Peters)
   + fragmentation starvation
 * At high mass, high escape velocity, there is less unbound material
 * stellar winds relatively unimportant because of their rarity
   + B-stars give SNe, but not wind

Radiation Pressure
 * more effective if more scattering
   + Krumholz & Matzner, Fall: Momentum Driven (0-1 scatterings)
   + Thomson, Murray, Hopkins: Energy Driven (many-scattering)
 * Multi-scattering fails: RT instability
   + scattered radiation never dominant
 * Lopez 2013: HII-region pressure always dominant; hot gas slightly lower

 * Q Fan of CR driven winds.  Galactic winds are multi-phase.  Thoughts?
 * A:
 * Q Thomas Henning: What about positive feedback?
 * A: Will be addressed in next talk.  But, positive feedback is a 10% effect

Molecular cloud formation in stellar feedback flows: Observing, demonstrating, quantifying: Joanne Dawson
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HI GASS + 12CO
 * effect of supershells on molecular gas fraction
   + shells are more molecular than surroundings
 * LMC: supergiant shells have comparable molecular gas fraction to the rest of the gas 
   + Large scale: No effect
   + small scale: drive up *local* molecular gas fraction
 * OB cluster feedback: Not a major driver, but an important secondary role

 * Q Zinnecker: How did 30 Dor form?

Disruption of GMCs by photoionization and stellar winds - setting the stage for supernovae. Jim Dale
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The time between first O-stars and first SNe
 * mass loss is a strong effect of escape speed
 * Leakage?  Approximate winds as momentum fluxes
   + leakage rate constant across M/R space
 * Effect of 1st SN?
   + no effect/small effect for high-mass clouds

Do you have predictions for velocity of knots as a function of distance or time?  Rocket effect?
Can "Rocket Effect" drive out gas?

The evolution of molecular clouds under the influence of ionizing radiation 15': Matthias Gritschneder
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pipe Nebula affected by feedback
O vs B star
 * B-star does not generate structure
   + heats shell
   + stays very smooth
 * O-star compresses

Feedback-driven turbulence in the multi-phase ISM 15': Andrea Gotto (MPA)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cannot reproduce HI velocity dispersion

Understanding ultracompact H II regions 15': Thomas Peters
----------------------------------------------------------
HII region morphologies
 * no relation between age of star and size of HII region
 * probabilistic flux decrements
 * SgrB2: 1 shrinking, 2-3 growing
   + predictions & observations match exactly
 * ALMA outflow predictions
 * K 3-50A VLA + CARMA observations
   + Pamela Klaasen 14.7 GHz obs of K3-50a
   + ionized gas entraining molecular gas

 * models do not include dust absorption 

ALMA proposal for Sgr B2?
Prediction for 3mm observability?

An analytic model for the dynamics of the ionized outflows of massive protostars 15': Keto
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Observations that aren't explained by expanding shell
 * supersonic velocities in HII region
 * SED indicates density gradients
 * Modified Hollenbach photoevaporating disk model
   + velocity gradient of RRL not tied to disk or outflow
   + "Ballistic Infall" model

 * Q: Look similar to simulations of champagne flows.

Deciphering the violent interaction between very massive stars and their natal clouds in the Carina Nebula Complex 15': Thomas Preibisch
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carina:
 * HAWK-I NIR stellar population study
 * CCCP Chandra 10,000 stars
 * 60,000 msun in gas
 * 10^6 msun total... half cold
 * 300,000 msun of CO
 * 1% of total SF in galaxy
 * G0 ~100-1000
 * hot wind gas (X-ray) flows out: anticorrelated with 70um Herschel

 * Q How do you know SFE is increasing (currently 3%)?
 * A: We see it going on now.  Stellar mass is increasing.  Efficiency must increase further.
 * Q Nicola Schneider: What if the pillars are eroded filaments?  Revealed, not triggered?
 * A: Same mechanism? (unclear)
 * Q Hennebelle:  Where is most of the mass?  only 1/3 in CO?
 * A: 1/2 - 2/3 still in atomic gas

Models for the circumstellar medium of massive runaway stars 15': Dominic Meyer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bow shocks from runaway RSGs
 * v*/vwind >> 1 -> stable bow shock
   + slow stars -> unstable
 

Dynamics of H II regions around exiled O stars 15': Jonathan Mackey
-------------------------------------------------------------------
25% of O-stars ejected
 * once in diffuse ISM, easier to feedback on Galactic scales
 * Zeta Ophiuci d~112pc, proper motion known, LOS velocity unknown
 * bow shock is 5 degrees! across, ~10pc
