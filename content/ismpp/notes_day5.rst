-------------
High-redshift
 * Outflows with mass-loading parameters 1-10 
 * velocity dispersions 25-80 km/s
   + seen in both CO and H-alpha

Avishai Dekel: Violent Disk Instability
---------------------------------------
Galaxies form at nodes in web at high z
 * disk surrounded by messy "interaction region"
 * disk outflows observed
 * Toomre unstable clumps ~10^9 msun
   + dynamically dominant (unlike MW clumps)
   + violent instability, not secular
 * long time spent in disks
 * Stellar-dominated galaxies at z~1 stop "VDI"
   + bulge stabilizes inner part of galaxy
 * "clumps" are rapidly spinnign
 * both VDI and "ex-situ" dark matter clumps
 * universal SF law: divide by t_ff
   + t_ff is either Toomre tff or gmc tff
 * "redshift 2 is the only important phase, forget about z=0"

 * Steve: How does "universal law" fit with Galactic CMZ?
   + Ignorance.  Ask Mark.
 * Rahul: Toomre Q threshold only works for infinitely thin disk.  Shouldn't
   threshold be lower because of thick disk?
 * Goldreich & Linden-Bell: 30% effect.  Elmegreen addresses this.
