---------------
GMC lifetime: 100 Myr (Scoville 79, Koda)
Size-linewidth relation: 

 * Heyer 2001: small, flat dispersion clouds
 * outer galaxy clouds contained by external pressure

Dust in IGM hints at molecular Galactic outflows

Jin Koda: Molecular to Total gas ratio
--------------------------------------
inner 1 kpc 100% molecular
 * 20-30% arm/interarm variations
 * molecules within interam and in arms, but clumps only in arms
   + Sawada 2012
   + Power-Law tails in arms, but not in interarms
 * GRS more clumpy in arms     
 * arm/interarm comparison in M51
   + 2-3x increase in T or rho in spiral arms

 * Q Diederich: interarm clouds short-lived?  Not self-gravitating?
 * A: Molecular gas is surviving, small clumps are self-gravitating

 * Why is BDI higher at tangent point?
 * What about Bania's clump?

Superbubbles as a physical process in the ISM 15': Martin Krause
----------------------------------------------------------------
Al26 is much faster than spiral arms
 * Too fast orbital velocity...

My question: What is the scale height?  What directions is the Al26 going?
 * expand 100 pc in all directions except back along the line of sight
   + Are the velocities consistent with the stellar velocity distribution?

Star Formation in molecular gas outside galaxies: Ute Lisenfeld
---------------------------------------------------------------
Galaxies star forming, extragalactic gas with high column & high velocity dispersion not
 * colliding galaxies: intergalactic region full of molecular gas

Andreas Schruba: CARMA + IRAM Andromeda survey
----------------------------------------------
 * All-galaxy survey with IRAM
   + 175 hr, 335 mosaic for "Brick 15"
 * most clouds unbound or pressure bound
 * size-linewidth relation: still lots of scatter
 * sigma^2/r vs surface brightness (same as Heyer 2009 plot)
   + no correlation with any parameters...
 * clouds in strongest star-forming regions have largest LOS velocity differences

Rahul Shetty: KS fitting
------------------------
Linear relation indicates constant depletion timescale
 * super-linear: efficiency increases with increasing density
 * linear: constant efficiency with gas density
   + GMCs all have similar/same properties
   + t_dep = 2 Gyr
 * CO traces individual clouds
 * sublinear indicates non-star-forming CO
 * no universal or representative depletion time
   + depletion time increases with CO 

 * Adam Leroy: Surface density of H2 doesn't match surface density of molecular clouds
 * Jin: Also found superlinear.  Systematic bias?

Javier Cardiel: Two regimes of SF
---------------------------------
Looking for triggering
 * density decreases with size increasing?
 * HII regions and molecular clouds have same size-mass relations

Steve Longmore: ISM in Galactic Centers
---------------------------------------
dolphin riding?
Where is MW in hubble tuning fork?

 * dense gas with no star formation driven inwards by bar
 * Meidt M51 PAWS

Molinari Ring: closed orbit...
M83 is a twin
Jay Gallagher's talk: SFR much, much higher in NGC 253 than MW
Discrepancy between Farhad, Steve, and Sandstrom

 * TOTAL gas: CMZ agrees
 * Geometry: Farhad assumed pancake, Steve assumed ring

Kruijssen & Longmore similarity to z=2-3...
 * CMZ clouds "indistinguishable" in a few parameters from high-Z
Turbulent pressure provides the support in the CMZ
 * environmentally dependent density threshold

 * Q Rowan: Constant gradient in cloud properties along the ring?
 * Q Semadeni: Turbulence can't provide support.
 * Q Keto: Nothing can supply the turbulence
 * Q Falgarone: HCO+ absorption, daughter of CO+.  Could trace sites of
   turbulence in the medium.  Low density.  Line width comes from intense
   shear.

Tim Davis: ISM in early-type galaxies
-------------------------------------
ISM in CMZs different
 * some are predominantely molecular (no HI)
 * cluster members have different NII/CII ratios
 * lower star forming efficiency
 * shear increases depletion time

 * Q Burkhart: Origin of gas.  Replenishment from stars?
 * A: Based on gas vs star kinematics, at least 50% must be accreted.  
 * Q Kruijssen: Stripping would happen if disk extends to optical radius.  Does it?  Stars should be stripped too
 * A: Don't extend to optical radius, but more truncated in clusters
 * Q Leroy: Where does tff claim come from...?
 * A: assume all mol clds have 85 msun/pc^2...
