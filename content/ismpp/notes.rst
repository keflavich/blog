Notes from the ISM-PP conference
================================

The thickness distribution of interstellar filaments: Evangelia Ntormousi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filament decomposition

 * RAMSES MHD with/without ambipolar diffusion (AD)
   + effect of ambipolar diffusion is smoothing
   + AD builds *very slight* secondary peak
 * Q Crutcher:  How strong B-fields?  AD driven by turbulence (or what drives it)?
 * A: Yes, turbulence drives it.  B-fields ???
 * Q MacLow: Alfven waves suppressed by AD, but magnetosonic go through & drive small flows.
   Oishi & MacLow: no break in power-spectrum at small scales. Consistent with
   small difference.
 * A: Yes, maybe smaller scale motions.
 * Q Keto: Keep B-fields coherent.  But don't need to keep them coherent.  
   How does B-field keep filaments coherent?  Argues that they only last a
   crossing time.
 * A: magnetic tension, resists shear.  Filaments would reexpand without
   B-fields.  We don't see observed reexpansion.

Anomalous extinction: The degeneracy between dust composition and geometry 15': Peter Scicluna (ESO)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forward scattering by dust
 
 * direct forward scattering favored
 * flatter extinction curve when optically thick
 * Q Keto: Wavelength dependence of scattering?  Mostly absorption -> IR reemission?
 * A: absorption is treated.  Heating.
 * Q Star outside scattering into LOS?
 * A: Yes, but probably not *as* significant

Molecular cloud properties 40': Alvaro Hacar
--------------------------------------------
Skipped

The structure of molecular clouds from 1000 AU to Orion 15': Joao Alves
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Extinction Mapping (in Orion)
 * Stars at 2um are colorless
 * Bias: not sensitive to densest part of cloud
   + NICEST accounts for background population
 * PIPE: high temperatures in the low-column stuff
 * Barnard 68 is a bonnor ebert - 2001 result..
   + TP role of B68!
 * Most BE cores are stable (Lada 2008)
   + pressure confined
 * CMF claim...
   + "same thing seen by Andre 2011"
 * Burkert Alves 2009: merging cores
 * Hacar 2013: multiple LOS velocity components along a single filament
   + friends-of-friends velocity components: subsonic
   + broad line consists of spaghetti
   + most filaments have no cores 
 * summary of Lada, Lombardi led papers
 * Corona Australis cloud (Avles et al submitted)
   + PDF very lognormal with a tiny power-law excess
   + Kainulainen did the PDF work...
     - sometimes loglog gives insight...
   + mentioned my poster as rejecting lognormal (oops - that result changed since I wrote the abstract...)
 * NICEST future?
   + GNICER
   + do it to other galaxies?
     - nice extinction mapping in CNR of M83
 * Bally CMZ...
   + M83 analogy?
 * Q Herschel maps: larger dynamic range
 * A: VLT + Spitzer -> A_V ~ 100
 * Q: Features in PDF are clearly associated with individual objects.  PDFs extremely useful...
 * A: Still throwing away second dimension.  Justin Bieber has same PDF as Pipe Nebula.  Hat tip to Chris Beaumont
 * Q Falgarone: Search for thinning of filaments?  Change of spinning?
 * A: 1km/s/pc still...
 * Q Vazquez-Semadeni: Is B68 inside an HII region or not?
 * A: No.  Herschel data shows tail of warm dust being blown away.  Some
   external agent removed filament B68 was born in.
   External pressure is higher outside B68 than in, e.g., Taurus.
 * Q Zinnecker: B68.  Structure more complex?  Niel Boch?  Not isothermal?
 * A: BE are isothermal; fit cores well a lot.  BE still decent representation.
 * Q Klessen: Degeneracy distribution highly degenerate.  Possible to reproduce
   from turbulence without contained sphere.
 * A: No change in B68.  Long, subsonic things.
 * "Danger is applying one model to everything." -Klessen
 * "Shouldn't apply turbulence to everything." -Alves
 * Keto: Non-isothermal = factor of 2?  Numerical models say doesn't strongly
   affect dynamics, still acts BE-like.
 * Vasquez-Semadeni: We are taking turbulence too far!  But these are not
   stable either.

Herschel view of mol cld structure & SF: Nicola Schneider
---------------------------------------------------------
Unscheduled talk.
 * massive stars at junctinos of filaments
 * DR21, Taurus
   + "striations" correlated with B-fields
 * Herschel PDF goes to higher density
 * ChamII: subtract sources, get lognormal (kinda)
   + "weak" slope difference in power law tails
 * compressed shells -> double-peak, broadened PDF
 * Q Joao: 2 power laws.  Coincide with OB stars.  Could it be unaccounted for temperature increase?
 * A: 
 * Q Kainulainen Cham II: Subtracted bound cores.
 * A: A_V > 10 is core collapse

 * Q: in PDFs, are the pixels all independent, or does the PDF from a single bright source contribute to many bins?
 * A: Too many pixels

Properties of interstellar filaments observed with Herschel and 3D magnetic field structure derived from the polarization parameters observed with Planck 15': Doris Arzoumanian
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constant filament width
 * 0.1 pc
B-fields in filaments
 * geometry of field can lead to depolarization

 * Q Crutcher: Polarization fraction is much higher than observed in cores.  Very minor effect.
 * A: Cores would be lower.

Magnetic Fields in Bok globules 15': Gesa Bertrang
--------------------------------------------------
Supercritical: B-fields play no role
 * comparison of NIR and submm poln
 * VLT/ISAAC poln

 * Q Zinnecker: IR poln vector vs B-field.  Radiative acceleration vs B-field alignment?
 * Q Keto: How do you know surrounding gas is associated with core?
 * A: We don't see anything else in the images.  The globules are very isolated

"Bok Globules" sounds very like "Buckyballs"

Effect of turbulence on the density statistics of molecular clouds: an observational view: J Kainulainen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Density structure dominated by turbulent motions
 * Yields a lognormal function
 * powerlaw tail from gravity
 * assume that 2D pdf can be used to yield 3D pdf
 * Can't use background stars at N kpc...
   + high dynamic range: 3-120x10^21 cm^-2
   + 2" res
 * avoid LOS contamination by using a column cutoff
 * use 8 clouds to determine b
 * "First direct observation determination of b"
 * Dense gas mass fraction
   + lognormal PDF -> exponential DGMF
   + IRDCs have greater "fraction" of high density gas

 * COMMENT: You CAN estimate the volume density.
 * Yes, I agree, I can do it too.

 * Q: Vazquez-Semadeni.  Low b suggests more solenoidal than compressive.
 * A: B-field squishes PDF.  
 * A: b-parameter drives SF.  B-field close second.
 * Q: How do you handle projection effects?
 * A: Not observationally, but simulations seem to show we're doing OK
 * Q Hennebelle: Equation of state.  Higher adiabatic index leads to different PDF.  
 * A: Should repeat experiment...
 * Q Nicola Schneider: How do you get Mach number?  I get much lower Mach
   number.  Why is there no clearly defined power-law tail?
 * A: Mach #: line width, assume temperature, -> 3D vel dispersion. 
 * A: We need quantitative comparison between Herschel & extinction map.
   Depends on scale.  We could fit with power-laws.  But, looks like lognormal..
 * A: MAYBE powerlaw tails due to gravity.  Maybe not!  Maybe young IRDCs not
   dominated by gravity.

Filamentary Structures in the ISM 15: Rowan Smith
-------------------------------------------------
Arepo!
 * time dependent chemistry
 * molecular cloud factory
 * filamentary structures generated
 * filaments examined with DiSPERSE
   + can generate filaments with shallow profiles with or without B-fields 
 * How do 2D filaments match 3D filaments?
 * DiSPERSE connects maxima: Cores are forced onto filaments!
 * Question for the audience: How do you fit a filament with a gaussian?
 * 3D reasonably consistent with 2D?
   + but major degeneracy between R-flat and p

 * Q Hennebelle: Why do you need B-fields for a shallow profile?
 * A: You *don't* need B-fields for shallow profiles.
 * (more conversation that was probably important but I missed it)
 * Q: filaments embedded in hot medium, not same as mol cloud filaments
 * Q: Xu - We found a filamentary wisp just like what you saw
 * Q: Adam Leroy: Why did you pick a particular number for the CO?
 * A: *If* my sensitivity to CO is a certain value, how much gas do I miss?
   Cumulative plots help avoid "threshold"
 * Q Adam: Would you make this back up by filling beam with faint CO?
 * A: Haven't looked at beam sizes yet.
 * Q Zinnecker: How do you get H2 at such low CO values?  Such low extinction, shouldn't H2 go away?
 * A: Very well self-shielding

Turbulence in the ISM 30': Fabian Heitsch
-----------------------------------------
Turbulent mixing -> serious resolution issues?
 * Fragmentation rather than support
 * lognormals are easy to generate
How is turbulence driven? (how does it arise?)
 * Hydrodynamic eqns -> dispersive and curly components
   1. Gradients in the velocity field (shear)
   2. Angular momentum conservation term: vorticity increases when gas
      compressed.  Make something smaller -> spin up
   3. Pressure / density misaligned -> turbulence.  Thermal instability.
 * "Turbulence in the ISM is a *consequence*"
Turbulence decays
 * On a dynamical timescale?
   + lifetime can be extended somehow...
 * Drivers?
   + Expansion of shells
   + Global graviational instability
