The thickness distribution of interstellar filaments: Evangelia Ntormousi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filament decomposition

 * RAMSES MHD with/without ambipolar diffusion (AD)
   + effect of ambipolar diffusion is smoothing
   + AD builds *very slight* secondary peak
 * Q Crutcher:  How strong B-fields?  AD driven by turbulence (or what drives it)?
 * A: Yes, turbulence drives it.  B-fields ???
 * Q MacLow: Alfven waves suppressed by AD, but magnetosonic go through & drive small flows.
   Oishi & MacLow: no break in power-spectrum at small scales. Consistent with
   small difference.
 * A: Yes, maybe smaller scale motions.
 * Q Keto: Keep B-fields coherent.  But don't need to keep them coherent.  
   How does B-field keep filaments coherent?  Argues that they only last a
   crossing time.
 * A: magnetic tension, resists shear.  Filaments would reexpand without
   B-fields.  We don't see observed reexpansion.

Anomalous extinction: The degeneracy between dust composition and geometry 15': Peter Scicluna (ESO)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forward scattering by dust
 
 * direct forward scattering favored
 * flatter extinction curve when optically thick
 * Q Keto: Wavelength dependence of scattering?  Mostly absorption -> IR reemission?
 * A: absorption is treated.  Heating.
 * Q Star outside scattering into LOS?
 * A: Yes, but probably not *as* significant

 Q Vazquez-Semadeni: What happens when plane hits turbulence?
 A: Counterweight keeps telescope pointed in the right place

Molecular cloud properties 40': Alvaro Hacar
--------------------------------------------
Skipped

The structure of molecular clouds from 1000 AU to Orion 15': Joao Alves
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Extinction Mapping (in Orion)
 * Stars at 2um are colorless
 * Bias: not sensitive to densest part of cloud
   + NICEST accounts for background population
 * PIPE: high temperatures in the low-column stuff
 * Barnard 68 is a bonnor ebert - 2001 result..
   + TP role of B68!
 * Most BE cores are stable (Lada 2008)
   + pressure confined
 * CMF claim...
   + "same thing seen by Andre 2011"
 * Burkert Alves 2009: merging cores
 * Hacar 2013: multiple LOS velocity components along a single filament
   + friends-of-friends velocity components: subsonic
   + broad line consists of spaghetti
   + most filaments have no cores 
 * summary of Lada, Lombardi led papers
 * Corona Australis cloud (Avles et al submitted)
   + PDF very lognormal with a tiny power-law excess
   + Kainulainen did the PDF work...

     - sometimes loglog gives insight...

   + mentioned my poster as rejecting lognormal (oops - that result changed since I wrote the abstract...)
 * NICEST future?
   + GNICER
   + do it to other galaxies?

     - nice extinction mapping in CNR of M83

 * Bally CMZ...
   + M83 analogy?
 * Q Herschel maps: larger dynamic range
 * A: VLT + Spitzer -> A_V ~ 100
 * Q: Features in PDF are clearly associated with individual objects.  PDFs extremely useful...
 * A: Still throwing away second dimension.  Justin Bieber has same PDF as Pipe Nebula.  Hat tip to Chris Beaumont
 * Q Falgarone: Search for thinning of filaments?  Change of spinning?
 * A: 1km/s/pc still...
 * Q Vazquez-Semadeni: Is B68 inside an HII region or not?
 * A: No.  Herschel data shows tail of warm dust being blown away.  Some
   external agent removed filament B68 was born in.
   External pressure is higher outside B68 than in, e.g., Taurus.
 * Q Zinnecker: B68.  Structure more complex?  Niel Boch?  Not isothermal?
 * A: BE are isothermal; fit cores well a lot.  BE still decent representation.
 * Q Klessen: Degeneracy distribution highly degenerate.  Possible to reproduce
   from turbulence without contained sphere.
 * A: No change in B68.  Long, subsonic things.
 * "Danger is applying one model to everything." -Klessen
 * "Shouldn't apply turbulence to everything." -Alves
 * Keto: Non-isothermal = factor of 2?  Numerical models say doesn't strongly
   affect dynamics, still acts BE-like.
 * Vasquez-Semadeni: We are taking turbulence too far!  But these are not
   stable either.

Herschel view of mol cld structure & SF: Nicola Schneider
---------------------------------------------------------
Unscheduled talk.
 * massive stars at junctinos of filaments
 * DR21, Taurus
   + "striations" correlated with B-fields
 * Herschel PDF goes to higher density
 * ChamII: subtract sources, get lognormal (kinda)
   + "weak" slope difference in power law tails
 * compressed shells -> double-peak, broadened PDF
 * Q Joao: 2 power laws.  Coincide with OB stars.  Could it be unaccounted for temperature increase?
 * A: 
 * Q Kainulainen Cham II: Subtracted bound cores.
 * A: A_V > 10 is core collapse

 * Q: in PDFs, are the pixels all independent, or does the PDF from a single bright source contribute to many bins?
 * A: Too many pixels

Properties of interstellar filaments observed with Herschel and 3D magnetic field structure derived from the polarization parameters observed with Planck 15': Doris Arzoumanian
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constant filament width
 * 0.1 pc
B-fields in filaments
 * geometry of field can lead to depolarization

 * Q Crutcher: Polarization fraction is much higher than observed in cores.  Very minor effect.
 * A: Cores would be lower.

Magnetic Fields in Bok globules 15': Gesa Bertrang
--------------------------------------------------
Supercritical: B-fields play no role
 * comparison of NIR and submm poln
 * VLT/ISAAC poln

 * Q Zinnecker: IR poln vector vs B-field.  Radiative acceleration vs B-field alignment?
 * Q Keto: How do you know surrounding gas is associated with core?
 * A: We don't see anything else in the images.  The globules are very isolated

"Bok Globules" sounds very like "Buckyballs"

Effect of turbulence on the density statistics of molecular clouds: an observational view: J Kainulainen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Density structure dominated by turbulent motions
 * Yields a lognormal function
 * powerlaw tail from gravity
 * assume that 2D pdf can be used to yield 3D pdf
 * Can't use background stars at N kpc...
   + high dynamic range: 3-120x10^21 cm^-2
   + 2" res
 * avoid LOS contamination by using a column cutoff
 * use 8 clouds to determine b
 * "First direct observation determination of b"
 * Dense gas mass fraction
   + lognormal PDF -> exponential DGMF
   + IRDCs have greater "fraction" of high density gas

 * COMMENT: You CAN estimate the volume density.
 * Yes, I agree, I can do it too.

 * Q: Vazquez-Semadeni.  Low b suggests more solenoidal than compressive.
 * A: B-field squishes PDF.  
 * A: b-parameter drives SF.  B-field close second.
 * Q: How do you handle projection effects?
 * A: Not observationally, but simulations seem to show we're doing OK
 * Q Hennebelle: Equation of state.  Higher adiabatic index leads to different PDF.  
 * A: Should repeat experiment...
 * Q Nicola Schneider: How do you get Mach number?  I get much lower Mach
   number.  Why is there no clearly defined power-law tail?
 * A: Mach #: line width, assume temperature, -> 3D vel dispersion. 
 * A: We need quantitative comparison between Herschel & extinction map.
   Depends on scale.  We could fit with power-laws.  But, looks like lognormal..
 * A: MAYBE powerlaw tails due to gravity.  Maybe not!  Maybe young IRDCs not
   dominated by gravity.

Filamentary Structures in the ISM 15: Rowan Smith
-------------------------------------------------
Arepo!
 * time dependent chemistry
 * molecular cloud factory
 * filamentary structures generated
 * filaments examined with DiSPERSE
   + can generate filaments with shallow profiles with or without B-fields 
 * How do 2D filaments match 3D filaments?
 * DiSPERSE connects maxima: Cores are forced onto filaments!
 * Question for the audience: How do you fit a filament with a gaussian?
 * 3D reasonably consistent with 2D?
   + but major degeneracy between R-flat and p

 * Q Hennebelle: Why do you need B-fields for a shallow profile?
 * A: You *don't* need B-fields for shallow profiles.
 * (more conversation that was probably important but I missed it)
 * Q: filaments embedded in hot medium, not same as mol cloud filaments
 * Q: Xu - We found a filamentary wisp just like what you saw
 * Q: Adam Leroy: Why did you pick a particular number for the CO?
 * A: *If* my sensitivity to CO is a certain value, how much gas do I miss?
   Cumulative plots help avoid "threshold"
 * Q Adam: Would you make this back up by filling beam with faint CO?
 * A: Haven't looked at beam sizes yet.
 * Q Zinnecker: How do you get H2 at such low CO values?  Such low extinction, shouldn't H2 go away?
 * A: Very well self-shielding

Turbulence in the ISM 30': Fabian Heitsch
-----------------------------------------
Turbulent mixing -> serious resolution issues?
 * Fragmentation rather than support
 * lognormals are easy to generate
How is turbulence driven? (how does it arise?)
 * Hydrodynamic eqns -> dispersive and curly components
   1. Gradients in the velocity field (shear)
   2. Angular momentum conservation term: vorticity increases when gas compressed.  Make something smaller -> spin up
   3. Pressure / density misaligned -> turbulence.  Thermal instability.
 * "Turbulence in the ISM is a *consequence*"
Turbulence decays
 * On a dynamical timescale?
   + lifetime can be extended somehow...
 * Drivers?
   + Expansion of shells
   + Global graviational instability
 * Vazquez-Semadeni simulation: gravitational collapse drives turbulence in a "core"

How is turbulence driven in the models?
 * Local: Driven / fourier forcing
   + Choose amplitude in fourier space (Kolmogorov or Burgers)
   + Uniform random phase in fourier space
   + transform to real
   + apply forcing at every timestep (at constant luminosity)
 * Large scales feed smaller scales
 * Problems:
   + phases should be coherent (HII region shells are coherent)
   + driving is volume-filling!  (bow shocks!)
   + only makes sense if accretion timescale longer than crossing time (this is OK)
   + periodic box: uncertain jeans mass, virial parameter.
 * Alternative: cloud formation by colliding flows.

Support vs Fragmentation
 * assume turbulence is an extra support parameter
   + if true, one core should form 1 star instead of 100 (? this doesn't make sense to me)
   + Energy from out->in.  How does this yield support?
   + Turbulence isotropic on small scales?  Not true.  Most energy on largest scales.
   + mildly supersonic turbulence CAN support cores... M=10 doesn't

Turbulence doesn't work, so...?
 * turbulent support is line splitting... no hair splitting
 * turbulence REALLY leads to fragmentation

 * Q Jouni Kainulainen: Should we (observers) stop measuring CO line widths and
   calling it turbulent energy?
 * A: Don't stop measuring.  Turbulence support can't come from gravity-driven turbulence.
 * Q: Assumed anisotropic turbulence.    In B-fields, turbulence could be 2D.
 * A: Yes, but need dynamically dominant B-fields
 * Q Phillip Girichidis: Detailed description of how to model turbulence in
   simulations.  Matters whether *acceleration* or *force*.
 * A: We know what the difference is...
 * A Vazquez-Semadeni: Force -> acceleration depends on density.  Only get a
   lognormal when you have acceleration, *not* force.  Force -> dense regions
   accelerated less -> powerlaw.

Molecular cloud formation in converging flows 30': Patrick Hennebelle (SAp/CEA Saclay)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Converging flows
 * convert WNM -> CNM in "converging flows" (not shocks?)
 * alternative: bistable medium..
 * polytropic EOS -> powerlaw
   + 2-phase is strongly non-lognormal
   + but they consist of two separated lognormals 
 * molecular clouds are 2-phase: HI and H2 spatially coincident     
 * Mass spectrum "Higher order statistics"
 * mass-size-velocity dispersion relations "consistent with larson relation"
   + scatter still huge
 * Accretion of HI is adequate in early stages
   + maybe feedback is needed in later stages?
 * Magnetization is mass-dependent?

SF in colliding flows?

Filaments in MHD turbulence
 * don't need converging flows to get filaments
 * filaments from intersection of shocked sheets?
   + HD vs MHD: filaments form in HD, but they live longer in MHD
 * filament identification: inertia matrix -> eigenvectors -> filament direction
 * MHD -> greater elongation
   + B-field keeps filaments more coherent
   + B-fields weaken shocks, therefore shocks are not the formation driver of filaments

 * Q:Burkhert Coherence length scale in galaxies
 * Vazquez-Semadeni: Colliding flows are just a representation for any style of converging flow (e.g., grav instability)
 * Jin Koda: 500pc scale cloud formation, would expect GMC to follow flow.  But, we find retrograde & prograde.
 * A: Why do you expect spin?  Local turbulent motions...  at 500 pc, local turbulence comparable to shear.
 * Q Keto: If cloud initially forms as Jeans mass by grav frag process, so converging flows isn't really the explanation.
 * A: converging flows generated by gravitational collapse are still converging flows.
 * Q Klessen: distribution of spins arise naturally (because of curvature?)

On the characteristic mass of stars in stellar clusters 15': Paul Clark
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Try to take low density clouds (~100) and collapse them
 * Bate 2008 showed radiation limited fragmentation
 * heating/coolring rate strong function of density
   + photoelectric heating dominant
 * ISM physics in AREPO
 * vary turbulent driving (b=0.3, 0.5, 1)
 * take into account shielding
 * compressive, weak/strong G0: more small-scale filaments in low-G0 field
 * solenoidal: SF takes longer, more shreddy
   + solenoidal vs compressive take very different amts of time to create stars
 * difference in mass function at high mass
   + compressive with high G0 forms more massive stars
   + compressive case leaves gaps: more internal heating
 * systematically offset from Chabrier IMF: deficit of low-mass stars
   + not forming enough low-mass stars
   + Why? sinks prevent binary formation

Q: Is the solenoidal driving less mass to high density?  i.e., is the density distribution still the driver of SF?
 * Q Zinnecker: 
 * A: isothermal doesn't work (especially at high densities)
 * Q What about binaries?
 * A: Yes, that's it.

Photoionization of the diffuse ionised gas in an MHD supernova-driven turbulent Interstellar Medium Jo Barnes (University of St Andrews)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st year phd
 * explaining [N II]/Halpha line ratios, etc.
 * scattered light
   + HII region -> dust -> us
   + diffuse gas -> dust -> us
 * scattered/total ~ 0.5 at midplane.  at super high latitudes, can be 20% again

 * Q: Could low scale height be because SNe are not blown up together?
 * A: We use average SN rate, but arms should be enhanced

The molecular richness of diffuse ISM: a tracer of turbulent dissipation 15': Edith Falgarone
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussing diffuse medium
 * large range in physical scale of clouds
 * 5 order of magnitude scatter in transfer rate of kinetic energy.  
   + No trends with scale.
 * All forms of Larson relation fail at scales <0.1 pc
 * intermittency... most dissipation occurs in very small volume
   + dissipation occurs on filamentary structures
   + resolve pairs of CO-emitting regions corresponding to the dissipative high velocity shears
 * CH+ cation - known for 70 years, but poorly understood
   + highly endothermic formation
   + rapidly destroyed by H2, in ~1yr
   + requires extremely efficient formation rate
   + detected to be far too abundant
 * M82 LOS: detected in high latitude cloud!
   + gigantic inverse P-cygni from M82
   + infalling HVC tracer?
 * also detected CH+ to another galaxy at high latitude
 * Associated with HI (same line shape)
 * highly non-equilibrium chemistry
 * "TDR" = Turbulence Dissipation Region models

Q: CH+ seen drastically enhanced in diffuse clouds.  Should we expect gigantic abundance variations in dense molecular clouds too?

 * Q CH+ + B-fields?
 * Q Frequency of events?
 * A: 1% of gas
