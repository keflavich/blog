Definitely the best movie in the past... 3 years? IMAX didn't add much
to the experience though.
A little bit more: most people I've talked to about it (ummm... 2 grad
students and 1 blog?) thought the movie was overhyped and didn't live up
to the hype. I liked it a lot, and I never saw a single preview. Lesson?
Don't see previews.
