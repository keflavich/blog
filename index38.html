the 2005 Orion data shows a discrepancy between ds1 and ds5 data in
which the ds1 data is significantly (~10%) higher than the ds5 data.
However, the 2010 Uranus observations show much larger discrepancies
between ds1 and ds5 favoring the ds5 data! Because that was somewhat
unbelievable to me, I ran ds1-ds5 comparisons on Uranus data from other
epochs, and discovered that ds1&gt;ds5 uniformly (also, it looks a LOT
better).
So, the question remains, WHY is the Dec 2010 data brighter in ds5? More
confusing to me, why do the ds5 PSFs from 2010 look so reasonable, while
the ds5 PSFs from all earlier epochs look terrible?
For example, I use the observations 070727_o31 and _o32. These show
clearly the blurring and flux-loss that happens when ds5 data are used
for 'normal' point-sources:</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>From a comparison of 3 different epochs using about a dozen different
reduction techniques, but all with pairs of cross-scans, ds1 is
uniformly higher than ds5.
The only thing left to do is compare the individual scans, I suppose...
if the cross-scans behave differently, that explains the difference
between 2010 and other epochs</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The downsampling failure I <a class="reference external" href="http://bolocam.blogspot.com/2011/01/downsampling-has-serious-negative.html">noted</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://bolocam.blogspot.com/2011/01/more-evidence-that-downsampling-causes.html">previously</a> appears to be
illusory. It may be that the offset noted only holds for single-frame
images, in which there may be many blank pixels. It is possible - though
not certain - that the ds1 images were significantly higher than ds5
because more noise-only pixels were included with higher outliers; i.e.,
ds1 high-outlier noise was being compared to ds5 noise that was lower
amplitude.</p>
<p>What led to these conclusions? First, I was getting inconsistent results
looking at Uranus in particular - ds5 appeared to have higher fluxes
than ds1. This was inconsistent with <a class="reference external" href="http://bolocam.blogspot.com/2011/01/downsampling-has-serious-negative.html">earlier results</a> on OMC1. Partly,
this is because I switched from my <a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TTiWWl3j3dI/AAAAAAAAF3I/Ef3WHEv5oXU/s1600/omc1_dstest_pixel-pixel.png">hacked-together plots</a> to the much
more refined <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/bgpspipeline/source/browse/bgps_pipeline/plotting/compare_images.py">compare_images</a> script, which demonstrated the effect of
changing the cutoff of the comparison.</p>
<p>Also, I added in a Pearson Correlation Coefficient computation. Given a
single data set with the only difference being downsampling, the data
should be perfectly correlated even if there is a flux offset
(correlation should be 1, but the best fit slope should not be). It was
an indication of a problem when I started seeing correlation
coefficients &lt;0.90 for data that had already been sigma-cut; that means
that noise was being included in the correlation computations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the approach needed is to cut out the high pixels that are on
map edges. This I accomplished by adding an 'aperture' capability to the
compare_images code (for Uranus) and cropping using montage and a
wcs-based box for Orion.</p>
<p>The results... are ambiguous. Wow. In some sub-fields - within the same
co-added map - the agreement is near-perfect.</p>

<p>In others, ds1 is clearly &gt; ds5.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JsRH_ZQilWM/TVR-Os6vBSI/AAAAAAAAGAQ/JRR6Trm-weo/s1600/v2.0_dl_omc_b_OMC2_ds1ds5_compare.png" />
<p>What's going on? ds1 does look uniformly more smooth.
Note that the <em>disagreement</em> is nearly scale-free:</p>
<p>OK, so given the conclusion in Orion that ds1&gt;=ds5, what's the deal with
Uranus?</p>
<img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AosJ1vzcYSs/TVSZjIZ81fI/AAAAAAAAGAk/qVGeaJtkbPA/s320/101208_o10_ds1ds5_compare.png" />
<p>The first two comparisons are for 1x1° observations; in both cases ds1 &lt;
ds5, but by 6% and 24% respectively! The image of Uranus looks much
better (because of lack of parallel lines) in the second, more extreme
case. In both cases, the ds5 excess is nearly scale-free (not shown).</p>
<img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TVSZki9k9OI/AAAAAAAAGA0/t9LOGHOAL7Q/s320/101208_o10_ds1ds5_compare.png" />

<p>The 3x1s are also highly discrepant. #12 shows nearly perfect agreement,
albeit with high dispersion (low correlation) because of pixel-to-pixel
variations around the peak. #13 is the only observation with a huge DS1
excess. It also demonstrates very poor correlation. It looks like the
telescope got bumped for the ds5 data (which is not actually possible;
recall they're the same data set). What happened here? Maybe a glitch
that went unflagged (mad_flagger is off by default for individual
scans)?</p>
<img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9gwzGfDBCEk/TVSZllWeBxI/AAAAAAAAGA8/x3mg5RbMScs/s320/101208_o12_ds1ds5_compare.png" />

<p>In observations 4 and 5, we're looking at a 40-50% excess in ds5! What
the heck? There really is no clear explanation for this.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TVSaYfZx0WI/AAAAAAAAGBE/cWbbBQCJOvk/s320/101208_ob4_ds1ds5_compare.png" />

<p>But... what? Magically, they come into perfect agreement when the scan
axis nearly lines up with the coordinate axis! Or, is this just an
effect of the worse weather on night 2?</p>
<img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TVSaaP6ISNI/AAAAAAAAGBU/PvN5aFOxBAQ/s320/101209_ob5_ds1ds5_compare.png" />
<p>Next thing to try: masked source map comparison. Unfortunately, masking
royally screwed up the long scans - probably because the initial polysub
didn't work. And masking in the individual point source maps did
nothing... so that pretty much rules out atmospheric oversubtraction,
doesn't it?
What else could be causing this offset? 0pca looks the same as 13pca,
give or take, so it's not the atmospheric subtraction. Could the
downsampling result in an offset in the bolo-scaling? Where else in the
process could things go wrong? Tomorrow, need to investigate .sav files
with pyflagger...</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The fundamental problem at this point is making the pipeline run faster.
At current speeds, with undownsampled data, it may take ~days to process
a single map. Ideas for faster processing:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Find out how long it takes to converge to 1%, 5%.... If it only
requires 10 iterations, that's a factor of 2 savings over current
strategies.</li>
<li>Use downsampled data of some sort if possible. Does DS2 match DS1?
How do we measure it? Flux-flux comparison and PSF point-source size
measurements are the most important. Need to automate PSF
comparison....</li>
<li>Can we use median-combined individual images as a 0th order model? I
bet the answer is 'yes' and will probably increase the speed of
convergence by a large amount. Tests to run? This is probably needed
if we are to split up the 'super-fields' into smaller sub-fields,
otherwise overlapping data will be used less effectively.</li>
<li>Find some way to keep bgps.raw, bgps.ra, bgps.dec, and other items
that are only used once on the HD during the iterative process. Is
there any way to separate out data in a struct in this manner?</li>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>First comment - delining has <strong>no effect</strong> on downsampled data. At least
for the 0709 epoch, there were NO lines AT ALL in the data. From 0-5 Hz,
it was just empty. So we don't have to worry about that... the problem
only affects fully-sampled data.
Then, onto map comparisons. Curiously, the noise levels don't drop after
delining. They actually go up a bit. This may be because of the effects
on PCA cleaning.
However, flux levels in the sources go up by 0-10%. As usual, the change
in flux changes from field to field without any obvious reason.
Example 1: A pointing field. The source is ~2% brighter in the delined
version, but otherwise the match between the two is nearly perfect.</p>

<p>Example 2: A bigger map, where the flux recovery is much greater when
delining, but the background levels are also higher.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>One item I forgot to mention last night was the effects of
lines/delining on
PCA subtraction. These should be the primary effects on the final map
for all
epochs except 2010, in which case the primary effect SHOULD be to reduce
substantial noise.
In the examples below, there are PSDs of whole timestreams (left) and
example timestreams from single scans (right). The first thing to note
is that
the delined timestreams still have correlated components in the line
region,
but they are suppressed - their amplitudes, and therefore their sort
order in
the PCA removal scheme, are changed. Since PCA cleaning is by its nature
adaptive
(the number of components remains fixed, but the order changes), these
effects
can be significant and dangerous. If the line noise is more correlated,
a PCA
component will be dedicated to removing it instead of atmospheric
signal.
Below are examples from l089 (epoch 0709) first. These have less
correlated
line noise and are more typical of BGPS observations. The first PCA
component,
the average, does not change much with PCA cleaning. However it is clear
that
the second component changes substantially, from large-amplitude
high-frequency
noise to small-amplitude variations that are very likely to describe
atmosphere.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Delining refers to the process of removing electronic noise that is
aliased to
particular frequencies by the discrete sampling of the data. Typical
electronic noise is at 60 Hz with some width. It gets aliased to these
frequencies:
<tt class="docutils literal">linefreqs = <span class="pre">[10.05+findgen(10)*1.2,10.05-((findgen(7)+1))*1.2]</span></tt>
The 10.05 Hz and 20.10 Hz are the worst in most cases, and they are
wider. For
the above lines, we &quot;remove&quot; a bandwidth of 0.09 Hz by averaging over
the
neighboring 0.5 Hz on either side. For the wider lines, we remove 0.5 Hz
by
averaging over the neighboring 1.5 Hz on either side.
There are a few new things about the delining process that did not exist
in James' old version:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The wide-band lines are removed</li>
<li>A check is performed before removing the lines - they are only
removed if the line region mean is
2-sigma above the average region (as computed via median and mad)</li>
<li>The replaced noise is computed via median/mad, and the new noise
level is set 5x lower than in the
neighboring region</li>
</ol>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Now, some examples:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TUisqDHJ08I/AAAAAAAAF58/BpgnudfdAAw/s400/deline_timestreams_003.png" />
<img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TUisqWN6ueI/AAAAAAAAF6E/yAka7dlomjo/s400/deline_psds_003.png" />
<p>The timestream (left) and PSD (right) of a &quot;pretty good&quot; bolometer.
There is a lot of noise in lines, but note that the peak power is 2-3
orders of magnitude below the PSD peak. In this case the &quot;Power&quot; is in
Jy. There is little astrophysical information below ~14&quot; (9 Hz), and
there should be none below 7.2&quot; (17 Hz), but there is plausibly
information at these scales. It therefore makes sense to save as much
information as possible. As can be seen in the delined PSD, the peaks
drop by a substantial fraction, but not all the way - that's because
these lines are wider than typically observed. Unfortunately, I don't
have any really good ideas about how to fix this issue - I think fitting
gaussians to each line, while attractive, is going to be prohibitively
expensive in both programmer and processor time. However... it would be
a very interesting project to undertake. In the timestream, it can be
seen that the RMS drops substantially when the lines are filtered out
(note that the timestream is strongly dominated by large-scale
structure, so 'substantial' is really based on the RMS of the lines
removed).</p>
<img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TUisq6D55wI/AAAAAAAAF6M/PZ4hyu5FkZM/s400/deline_10hz_timestreams_003.png" />

<p>The next two plots look identical to the previous ones. In principle,
they include the wide-band delining. However, in this case, the
satellite lines to either side of the 10 Hz line are too strong and
prevent identification of the 10 Hz line. This is unfortunate, again,
but no obvious solution presents itself.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TUixLZbVHPI/AAAAAAAAF6c/xCWLpb9CKX4/s400/deline_timestreams_004.png" />

<p>Now we come to a truly problematic bolometer. The lines completely
dominate the power spectrum. Narrow line removal fails.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TUixMjNxbkI/AAAAAAAAF6s/Hr8ouprcMpY/s400/deline_10hz_timestreams_004.png" />

<p>Wide line removal does a much, much better job, dropping the RMS by an
order of magnitude.... but the bolometer probably still needs to be
removed, since the astrophysical signal is 2-3 orders of magnitude below
that.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TUizkq9x4TI/AAAAAAAAF68/2xYY86d6aTQ/s400/deline_timestreams_001.png" />

<p>The 2010 data had much worse line noise and had to be delined. JS
accomplished this by throwing out all data above a certain frequency,
but I prefer the delining approach. It is clearly effective, but again
leaves much to be desired. Should the flagged bandwidth be increased?
What about the extra lines around 18 Hz?</p>
<img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lsgW26mWZnU/TUizln1mSCI/AAAAAAAAF7M/hTkZRUU3-ck/s400/deline_10hz_timestreams_001.png" />

<p>Again, the wide line flagging fails because of the satellite lines.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Well, I did the work, so might as well come up with some plots...
I created a gaussian-fitting based delining code that saves all of the
fits in a text file! That's a lot of data to play with, and allows me to
draw some conclusions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>For the narrow lines, the linewidth (gaussian sigma) is 0.03 Hz. For
the wide lines, it is 0.05.</li>
<li>The amplitudes from December 2010 are ENORMOUS compared to others!</li>
<li>The width distributions of the two are similar, though the lines
appear to be significantly wider in July 2009</li>
</ol>
<p>I've also gotten to the point that I'm satisfied with how delining with
wing suppression works. Wing suppression is 0.4-2x quicker than fitting
directly, depending on... not clear what exactly; it depends on epoch,
but that could either be because there are more lines found or because
of relative data size. Does delining have to be done on whole
timestreams, or can it be done on a scan-by-scan basis? This is not
entirely clear... the peaks are less suppressed when done on a
scan-by-scan basis (presumably because the S/N is low and peaks are
therefore not detected), but incorrect suppression (removing a line
that's not there) is reduced. For short scans, the scan-by-scan approach
is 10x faster; for longer scans it's ~20% faster. I think the
scan-by-scan approach is going to be ideal.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Bleh, a whole day's work dedicate to new delining methods and testing.
Very unrewarding. However, there are results that I need to FINALLY
prove and show tomorrow:
1. amplitude suppression + phase preservation is a good alternative to
zeroing/scrambling or replacing with noise
2. line fitting is effective but slow
3. Assuming a line profile and suppressing is nearly as effective as
line fitting
4. scan-by-scan is less effective than observation-by-observation for
fitting (but it's not clear if that holds for other methods)</p>
