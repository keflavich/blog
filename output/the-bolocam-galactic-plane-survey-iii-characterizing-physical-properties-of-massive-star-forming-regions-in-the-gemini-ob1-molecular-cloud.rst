As with the other Bolocam papers, I reduced the data. All of the
analysis work was done by Miranda.
Because of Gem OB1's known distance (~2 kpc), it was possible to derive
the physical properties of all of the 34 BGPS sources. NH\ :sub:`3`
temperatures and line widths were combined to measure total dust mass,
density, and virial parameter. This paper is the best characterization
of "typical" BGPS sources, at least for the outer galaxy.
