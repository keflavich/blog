Why a blog? I've been strongly opposed to blogs for the longest time
(after all, Desert Strike coined the word BLOG as an acronym for
building), so why use one now?
1. link power - more links to my own pages if done correctly
2. google owns the blogger
2.a. google made it really easy
3. it's easier to add content here than to my real 'web page' which is
already too content-heavy. Still, my `web page`_ is more useful for
displaying code, my cv, etc.
4. needed a place to post beer reviews / brewing related content that
doesn't fit on a normal web page unless I made a blog there
5. easiest way to take notes that I can't just accidentally delete...
and now that I've made this post,
6. because I like metahumour
