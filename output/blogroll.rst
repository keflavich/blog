Since you're now subscribing (I'm assuming, at the moment and for the
next... say... year, Kyle's the only one who will see this), here's a
list of other blogs to check out:
`http://sketchbrewing.blogspot.com/`_
`http://thedrog.blogspot.com/`_
I'd send you to some other ones too, but they're not complete. I have
vague ambitions to write a genuine science blog for the international
year of astronomy and public outreach.... but I don't really know if
that will go anywhere.
