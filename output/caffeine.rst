Caffeine consumption stopped around mid-October. I think it was when I
got back from observing so October 20 give or take. Re-started
consumption mid-March. Date is hard to say... I think it was Sunday
before Spring Break, but hard to say because I still took it easy until
~last week.
Conclusions? I'm probably more tired in the mornings with caffeine than
without. Also, probably perform better @ ulty when I'm not addicted.
However.... not really conclusive. Just addictive.
