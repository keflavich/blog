Wow... 11 malts and 11 hops, and it tastes like at least 3 different
types of beer. There was an ale start and a porter finish to the first
few sips, but later ones had a fuller, maltier flavor at the top of the
mouth. It has some Irish Stout smoothness too. There's some residual
porter-esque bitterness. A lot of depth and complexity that keeps going.
Whew.
