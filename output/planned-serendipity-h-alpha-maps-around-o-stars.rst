Plenty of O-stars have been observed in H-alpha because they're in star
forming regions.  But there are plenty of others - runaways and the like
- that haven't.  A survey of these stars may turn up nearby ionized
features.  We may find externally illuminated AGB stars, allowing for
determination of their ejecta composition with diagnostic lines that are
usually unexcited and unavailable.  We may find bipolar ejection nebulae
or planetary nebulae with peculiar illumination patterns because they
are not centrally lit.

A good starting point & justification for this survey would be to
estimate the chance of a coincidence (within 5 pc?  10 pc?) of an O star
and an AGB star given purely random sampling.  Based on the detection of
SBW 2 in Carina, I think the odds must be pretty good.
