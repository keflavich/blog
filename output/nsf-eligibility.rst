   <p>

Am I eligible for the NSF GRFP? Sam says yes, I thought no, but
re-reading.... umm... isn't this yes?

::

    Applicants must have completed no more than twelve (12) months of full-time graduatestudy or its equivalent as of August 31, 2008. Full time graduate study is as defined by theuniversities attended.

No more than 12 months means 12 months is OK?
What was I thinking!?
