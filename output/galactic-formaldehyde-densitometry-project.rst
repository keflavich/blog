The Galactic Formaldehyde Densitometry Project is finally official and
on its way. I am PI of a joint Arecibo / Green Bank Telescope project to
survey formaldehyde, H2CO, in a sample of ~400 "dust clumps" in the
Galactic Plane. The clumps represent condensations within larger
molecular clouds that are likely to be forming stars, particularly
massive stars and star clusters.
Formaldehyde is uniquely useful for measuring densities of these gas
clumps. Because of a collisional selection effect, the low-lying
K-doublet transitions of H2CO undergo "anti-inversion", which means
their lower-energy states are overpopulated relative to the higher
states, and it can therefore be seen in absorption against the cosmic
microwave background. This unique property removes a key bias present in
emission line studies in which variable excitation conditions can
dominate the observability of a line.
For the next few posts, I will include calibration and data reduction
information from the observations in this survey. The Green Bank
observations are well underway, with nearly half of the sources observed
(though many at poor sensitivity) and the Arecibo observations have been
approved.
