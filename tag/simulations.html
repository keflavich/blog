        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Experiment 23, run in mid-May 2013, created power-law synthetic astrophysical
sky maps with added point sources in order to examine the pipeline + bolocat's
ability to recover point source flux densities accurately.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the BGPS v2 paper, this data is incorporated into Section
5.3: the angular transfer function and comparison with other data sets.</p>
<p>The parameter space explored includes 3 steps in power-spectrum background,
$\alpha_{ps}=1,1.5,2$, which is the major parameter being explored.  A
background with $\alpha_{ps}=2$ is approximately what we measure in both HiGal
and the reproduced regions of the BGPS power-spectrum, so it's probably the
most realistic, but it is also very bad for the pipeline: most of the power is
on the largest angular scales.  $\alpha_{ps}=1$, on the other hand,
beautifully creates point-source-like structures.</p>
<p>These two images show the results of $\alpha_{ps}=2$ and $\alpha_{ps}=1$
skies respectively with faint point sources on top.  The point sources are more
pointy and stick out more in the $\alpha_{ps}=1$ situation, but the
$\alpha_{ps}=1$ map also looks more generally point-like, so there is greater
confusion.  If you believe that there are genuine point sources in the 1.1 mm
maps, the $\alpha_{ps}=1$ would actually be very difficult to deal with since
many extracted sources would actually be part of the background.</p>

<p>We also explored two different sets of source brightnesses, 0.1-1 and 1-10
Jy/beam, uniformly distributed.  We picked a high source density, 500 in a
512x512 pixel map, to get decent source extraction statistics - the crowding is
still fairly low and does not significantly affect the extracted source
properties (only a few source overlap with others).  The bright sources are
obviously better-recovered than the faint, with good recovery for all of the
backgrounds explored.  The faint sources, on the other hand, were fairly
sensitive to the background.</p>
<p>The background levels used were $\sim1,2,10$ Jy/beam at the peak for the
$\alpha=2$ maps (they were lower for the other power-laws, so those will be
ignored from now on).  As described in the paper, the faint source recovery was
good for the low peak backgrounds, but recovery was essentially nonexistent for
the 10 Jy/beam background - point sources were not detected at all.</p>
<p>Despite the relative simplicity of this experiment, the data took 51 GB of
storage and took about half a day to run.</p>
<p>In principle, one would like to examine a range of different source
distributions (power-law flux distribution, upper/lower limits, sizes) on a
range of different power-spectrum backgrounds - for the purpose of the v2
paper, this approach would be thoroughly excessive.  However, I expect Tim will
be taking this sort of approach for the next paper.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>In the last couple drafts of the BGPS paper (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/bgpsv2/blob/master/v2_draft0515.pdf?raw=true">the May 15, 2013 draft</a>),
we've included a single simulation demonstrating the flux recovery of the
Bolocat:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://raw.github.com/keflavich/bgpsv2/master/figures/in_vs_out_bolocat_FLUX_40.png?login=keflavich&amp;token=8ff3096beef7bf15627a7a6b7363cb49" style="width: 800px;" />
<img alt="" src="https://raw.github.com/keflavich/bgpsv2/master/figures/in_vs_out_bolocat_FLUX_120.png?login=keflavich&amp;token=2c6e9896c5df6824e9881c94d6af542f" style="width: 800px;" />
<p>These figures are regarded as very important, as they demonstrate the
capability of recovering accurate flux density measurements from a realistic
sky using bolocat.</p>
<p>However, the above figures show a simulation only for one set of parameters,
with <span class="math">\(\alpha=1\)</span> in the power-law flux distribution, which unfortunately
is not realistic according to &quot;Figure 8&quot;:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://raw.github.com/keflavich/bgpsv2/master/figures/l030_higal_bgps_powerspec_compare.png?login=keflavich&amp;token=fa363ee3e28903c751c2a3c9f2b318a0" style="width: 800px;" />
<p>So I've started up a new experiment, experiment #23, to examine this problem.</p>
<p>The problem has a few layers:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The reason I used <span class="math">\(\alpha=1\)</span> is that it looks much like a realistic
BGPS map after processing, in the sense that most of the field is empty
but there are a few hundred sources in the map.  However, <span class="math">\(\alpha=1\)</span>
is not a realistic representation of the measured power spectra.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\alpha=2\)</span> maps with the previous normalization had a peak value of
18 Jy, which resulted in heavily signal-dominated output maps that did not
resemble BGPS maps.</li>
<li>The normalization is tricky.  One of the key goals of the simulations was to
test the effect of different atmospheric to astrophysical signal ratios on
the angular transfer function; in order to accomplish this, it was necessary
to scale the atmospheric power based on the astrophysical power at its peak
in fourier space.  i.e., in real timestreams, we can measure the astrophysical
to atmospheric power ratio, but we have to perform that measurement somewhere
that the angular transfer function is known to be reliable.  This is done at
about 1 Hz.</li>
<li>The normalization is important because of the noise level.  In the
simulations, we use a fixed noise level of about 30 mJy in the timestreams
to match our best observations (though it is not difficult to scale this to
other levels).  This fixed noise level means that, for some normalizations,
all pixels are statistically significant.  Also, even though the noise level
is fixed, it will be higher because of intrinsic noise in a power-law
distributed map.</li>
<li>The normalizations used in experiment #21, the angular transfer function
measurement, were selected such that there would be high signal-to-noise at
all angular scales.  This means that white noise would not be dominant on
any angular scale, since white noise is equivalent to <span class="math">\(\alpha=0\)</span>.  So
it wasn't crazy to use these ridiculously high-flux maps, but it is not
feasible to use the same maps for analysis of point sources.  In maps for
which we're interested in small-angular-scale features (&lt;100&quot;), we want the
maps to be primarily noise-dominated with a handful of bright features
either caused by adding point sources directly or from the local peaks in
the power-law distributed flux.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some notes along the way:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using a power-law background, the point-source sensitivity is much worse
than without a power-law background.   This is intuitive: a 100 mJy source
on a 200 mJy background (which may easily include power fluctuations on the
smallest scales of comparable magnitude) is not going to be recovered.</li>
<li>Doubly important: a 1 Jy source should have <em>peak</em> amplitude 1 Jy, but the
current method of adding point sources adds them as delta functions that are
later convolved, conserving the <em>total flux</em> rather than the <em>peak flux</em>.
This needs to be changed! (has been now)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some examples of what the before/after look like with point sources added.
The first has bright sources, the second faint sources:</p>

<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/bgps/images/bgps-point-source-recovery/BGPS_exp23_missingsrcs.png" style="width: 800px;" />
<p>With these new figures, the 40&quot; apertures work fine, but the 120&quot; apertures are
still utterly junk.  This does not make sense.</p>

<p>With background apertures:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/bgps/images/bgps-point-source-recovery/annulus_exam_bgapers.png" style="width: 800px;" />
<p>However, note that the background are computed using the <tt class="docutils literal">mmm.pro</tt>
sky-background estimation procedure over a range <span class="math">\(2r\)</span> to <span class="math">\(4r\)</span>
(i.e., 40-80&quot; and 120-240&quot; radius for the 40&quot; and 120&quot; diameter apertures).</p>
<p>The numbers shown by ds9 disagree fairly severely with those from bolocat.
In particular, it appears that the background estimate returned by <tt class="docutils literal">mmm.pro</tt>
is off by a factor of 2, in this case giving 0.42 instead of 0.97.  Turns out
this was due to an indexing error that did not affect the pipeline results in
any way.</p>
<p>Out of date analysis:
Bolocat's flux total in the 120&quot; aperture is 10.77 Jy/beam, background is 0.42
Jy/beam.  There are 218 pixels.  The resulting flux should be
(10.77-0.42*218/23.8), but this gives 6.9 instead of the expected 0.84.  Why?</p>
<p>If we do the same with the ds9 numbers, we get a total of 9.62 Jy/beam,
background 0.97 Jy/beam average, so: (9.62 - 0.97*218/23.8) = 0.74.
This is consistent with bolocat, and very very wrong.</p>
<p>If we take our background to be 1.02 instead of 0.97, we get 0.28 Jy/beam,
which is exactly the right answer according to the pipeline.  1.02 comes from
taking a much more local background subtraction from r=40 to r=80 arcsec,
which isn't really acceptable.  If we go from r=60 to r=120, the disagreement remains
fairly bad, with f=0.38 Jy/beam, but certainly a lot better.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Bolocat after the correction:
In [297]: [m20[61][f] for f in fields]
Out[297]: [0.18015364, 0.18674377, 0.00578439, 0.25477698, 0.29759517, 0.0041758944]

In [298]: [inp[61][f] for f in fields]

</pre>
<p>This may mean that we'll need to re-do aperture extraction with a tighter
background region everywhere.  I made the change to <tt class="docutils literal">object_photometry</tt>.</p>
<p>However, even with the change, even in the best case, <tt class="docutils literal">FLUX_120</tt> appears to
be totally unreliable.  <tt class="docutils literal">FLUX_80</tt> is acceptable with the change, but only for
bright sources (for faint sources, &lt;1 Jy, there is no recovery at all - I think this
must be an issue of the source brightness still not being calculated correctly):</p>

<p>I'll have to continue this analysis tomorrow once the full suite of simulations
has completed, but I strongly suspect that we'll have to recommend strictly
against using <tt class="docutils literal">FLUX_120</tt> if the background is expected to be <span class="math">\(\alpha=2\)</span>
distributed.</p>
<div class="section" id="day-2">
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>The simulations have partly completed.  After correcting the error with
convolved point sources vs.  delta functions, I reset the flux distributions to
be 0.05 to 1.0 Jy for the &quot;faint&quot; distribution and 0.1 to 50.0 Jy for the
&quot;bright&quot; distribution (both with power-law distributions <span class="math">\(\alpha=2\)</span>).</p>
<p>The results can be summarized:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>In the presence of complex background, i.e power-law distributed flux density
with amplitude comparable to the detected source brightness, only the smallest
aperture (40&quot;) is reliable (i.e., recovers a flux in the input and
processed map).</li>
<li>The recovered flux density has a very high dispersion in the presence of
high-amplitude power-law flux.  &quot;Very high&quot; = <span class="math">\(\sigma \gtrsim 1\)</span>
around a mean of 1.</li>
<li>There is no evident dependence of the maps on the atmospheric properties.
Therefore, there's no sense in varying the atmospheric properties in the
simulations.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided the simulations needed changing again.  First, there was excessive
sampling in astro/atmo parameter space; this is not needed (see point 3).  More
important is the power-law distribution map's peak flux.  Also, it is more
important to get decent sampling of bright-ish sources than to have a
&quot;physically accurate&quot; point source distribution; the distribution of sources
does not affect the recovery, but it does affect the signal-to-noise of the
recovery <em>measurement</em>.  Please don't ask me to defend this statement; it would
require another 10 hours of computer time + me time that I really don't want to
allocate, but I'm confident that it is true.</p>
<p>The essential conclusion is that, for <span class="math">\(\alpha=2\)</span>, point source recovery
is only possible if the point source is brighter than the background, which is
a very intuitive result.  Background annulus subtraction isn't very effective
at pulling out sources.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>These experiments show that source recovery is very poor in the presence of a
bright power-law background: it is not possible to reliably extract point
sources from a map filled with power-law distributed emission brighter than or
comparable to the point sources.</li>
<li>The 120&quot; apertures aren't really good for anything.</li>
<li>There is so much source-extraction parameter space out there that any
further study would really deserve its own paper.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additional plots of interest:</p>
<p>40&quot; aperture in the presence of a bright background with faint sources:</p>

<p>Versus the same with a faint background:</p>

<p>Compare these to the 120&quot; equivalents (bright then faint background):</p>

<p>It's fairly easy to see why there are issues with the bright background and the
120&quot; apertures.  In this image, bright background on the left, faint background
on the right, with faint sources (0.1-1 Jy).</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/bgps/images/bgps-point-source-recovery/faint_vs_bright_background.png" style="width: 800px;" />
<p>It's more helpful to look at that previous image with the source contours
superposed.  These images really give a nice feel for what it means to have
point sources subsumed in <span class="math">\(\alpha=2\)</span> background.</p>
