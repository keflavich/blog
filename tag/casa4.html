<p>An example using natural weighting:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/casa/tclean_compare.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>None of the methods are acceptable.  Multiscale is the worst, but hogbom is
extremely bad: there are major ringing artifacts (stripes parallel to the main
filament).</p>
<p>Disturbingly, even though I have given multiple scales, there are clearly no
non-pointlike scales in any of the model images, including mem, so I think
there's a major problem with tclean:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/casa/tclean_compare_models.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>I'm re-doing it with uniform weighting, because that's the case I was actually
interested in.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/casa/tclean_compare_uniform.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>The uniform tests come up with a clear and obvious answer: use clark clean, DO
NOT use any other methods as they are all unstable.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I'm trying to self-calibrate my A+C array C-band data on W51, since we're in a
clearly dynamic-range-limited regime.  I've never had any luck with self-cal,
though.  The images <em>always</em> get worse, and I still don't really understand
why.</p>
<p>This is a clue, though:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/w51/selfcal_phasecal_vs_time.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>For many of the antennae, especially those in C array, self-calibration results
in phase plots that look nice, with corrections confined to +/-30 degrees as
you would hope and expect.</p>
<p>These plots show that some antennae are going through dozens or hundreds of
phase wraps.  That is obviously unacceptable and incorrect: the original images
actually looked pretty good, so it is obvious (to me, at least) that there
should be <em>no</em> phase wrapping in the self-cal.  I'm surprised at this, since
each of these points should have S/N &gt; 3 and there is a lot of consistency in
these large phase shifts.</p>
<p>My suspicion is still that the clean process has failed.  I have been trying
multiscale clean, since the emission is completely dominated by extended
components.  However, even if I set smallscalebias to different values, there
are essentially no pointlike components being added to the clean model.  This
is wrong!  There are genuine point sources.  So I still suspect that this is a
modeling problem and the phase wraps are being caused by bad models.</p>
<p>I'm trying again with smaller pixels in the hope that a better match between
the beam size and the pixel size will produce a better model.  The only other
thing I can think to try is increasing the solint, but given the high S/N
already present, I doubt that's an important factor.</p>
<p>Smaller pixels didn't help, <em>but</em> forcing clean to include point-source
components by performing a second round of clean with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">multiscale=[]</span></tt> worked!
The solutions are MUCH more reasonable (no more phase wrap every integration),
and selfcal no longer diverges.  I also increased the solution interval to 30s
since it seems that the phase change timescale is significantly longer than
an integration.  I increased the S/N cutoff to 5 too.</p>
<p>There are still some &quot;noisy&quot; phases, even in the 3rd iteration:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/w51/selfcal_phasecal_vs_time_3rditer.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>I think more iterations may be necessary, but I will also increase the S/N
threshold to 6 and solint to 60s to see if that helps.</p>
<p>RMS improvements are evident but not spectacular:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
SPW4 Iteration 0: RMS=1.003e-04
SPW4 Iteration 1: RMS=6.009e-05
SPW4 Iteration 2: RMS=6.698e-05
SPW4 Iteration 3: RMS=7.061e-05
</pre>
<p>The bump in the last one is because I forgot to add a point clean for the last
iteration.</p>
<p>Perhaps not unfortunately, it looks like the improvements in image quality are
tiny when self-cal is added.  The only real hope now is that self-cal on all
bands will result in an artifact-free final combined image.</p>
<p>On the &quot;noisy&quot; phases, now that it looks like there are decent solutions, it
may actually be worth keeping the flags generated by applycal.  &lt;10% of the
data is being flagged out, which is negligible, and it probably is genuinely
bad (or signal-free, anyway) in that case.</p>
<p>EDIT: Looks better... or at least different... now:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
SPW4 Iteration 0: RMS=1.003e-04
SPW4 Iteration 1: RMS=5.962e-05

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I'm continuing to try to separate the line forest from the continuum data in my
W51 cube.  Some approaches 'kinda work', some don't.</p>
<p>The iterative approach suggested in the <a class="reference external" href="|static|cvel_w51_fail.rst">previous post</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/W51_ALMA_2013.1.00308.S/blob/630c60e7e57ea7b57877d66b15860b26419a5552/script_12m/uvcontsub_test.py">works reasonably well</a>,
but results in oversubtraction of the continuum, even with
a few iterations.  Note that this approach requires <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/W51_ALMA_2013.1.00308.S/blob/630c60e7e57ea7b57877d66b15860b26419a5552/script_12m/uvcontsub_test.py#L17">copying columns between ms
files using the table toolkit</a>.</p>
<img alt="Oversubtracted spectrum" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/w51/oversubtracted_spectrum.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>Another approach I wanted to try was to image the whole cube, take the minimum
value along the spectral axis, and subtract that.  This would avoid the
oversubtraction issue by force.  However, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/W51_ALMA_2013.1.00308.S/blob/c58e4fdf755f85b163d1684cc7383ef31d6a1669/script_12m/mincontsub.py">this</a>
leads to failures in the <cite>ft</cite> task:</p>

<p>which I don't understand.  I had to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/W51_ALMA_2013.1.00308.S/blob/c58e4fdf755f85b163d1684cc7383ef31d6a1669/script_12m/mincontsub.py#L22">hack the header</a>
just to get ft to load the file at all, and apparently my hack wasn't good enough.
It's really unclear to me now how to load a model from a FITS file.</p>
<p>The next approach is to load the whole continuum-subtracted cube into a model,
subtract THAT, then make a continuum image, then subtract that, then maybe
we have line and continuum?  Maybe?  I suspect this approach will require
some sort of cube masking.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ft is again the problem:</p>

<p>Followup in early 2017: a cube-based approach is generally more successful.

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I'm trying to get a good image of the W51 main sources that have line forests.
MFS clean does a pretty good job, but is very limited in dynamic range
presumably because the spectral lines manifest as amplitude errors.</p>
<p>I tried splitting the data to merge my two spectral windows using <cite>cvel</cite>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/W51_ALMA_2013.1.00308.S/blob/4c29c8dc763e3f994279d50db72b9a0dfc2a35b7/script_12m/split_for_localtests.py#L8">code</a>),
but I see thousands of errors like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
2015-11-02 19:52:15     WARN    SubMS::combineSpws()    Averaging failed for the following channel/correllation pairs from output row 44432 up to 44459. Corresponding visibilities will be flagged:

</pre>
<p>and when I image the cube, there is a jump at one channel that occurs because
the resolution suddenly changes either because SPW3 (the lo-res SPW) is not
included or because the hi-res one suddenly is.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/w51/cvel_jump.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>It doesn't look like there's any obvious workaround at the moment, but I'll
probably try sending another helpdesk ticket about this.</p>
<p>My best idea for getting a decent continuum out now is something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>image the whole cube in frequency</li>
<li>determine channels that can approximate the bright continuum</li>
<li>use those to uvcontsub the data</li>
<li>image the uvcontsub'd cube</li>
<li>uvsub the imaged spectral line cube from the original data</li>
<li>re-image the now-continuum-only cube using mfs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT: Dirk replied to the helpdesk ticket, suggesting:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Concerning cvel: try to process one SPW at a time. Otherwise cvel will
_combine_ the SPWs and if they are not observed at the same time, this will
lead to problems.
</pre>
<p>So I've now <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/W51_ALMA_2013.1.00308.S/blob/2d15ce46f9ecd75d70ab7ac4ee8f91b272139d9e/script_12m/split_for_localtests.py#L8">split the cvel into two commands</a>.
I also added <cite>outframe='bary'</cite> because otherwise it's not obvious that the
frequency command is doing anything
sensible or useful.  That's actually probably why I was getting non-overlapping
segments before - it tried converting to barycentric, but maybe too late in the
process (i.e., it tried selecting in topo, then converting to bary for output).
I also added a phasecenter, because it was automatically selecting pointing 24
as the phasecenter for cvel before.</p>
<p>This led to a new error:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
2015-11-03 14:38:27     WARN    cvel::SubMS::convertGridPars     *** Requested new channel width is smaller than smallest original channel width

</pre>
<p>which I've fixed by setting the output width to be 0.5 MHz, just a simple round
number greater than the input even accounting for shift.  Unfortunately, this
seems to have produced a dramatically larger output MS, which cannot be
correct.... ahhh, it turns out that was temporary, once regridding was complete,
it turned small again.</p>

cube, this wasn't a problem because I unintentionally cleaned only one of the
observations.  For the W51 and Orion data, I tried to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/W51_ALMA_2013.1.00308.S/blob/master/script_12m/scriptForImaging_fullcube.py">include all of the data</a>,
but that is causing problems.  Perhaps CASA does not work at all when 'channel'
is specified and the channels aren't aligned?  Or maybe it only accepts channels
when all channels exist?</p>
<p>I've now redone the 'full cube' imaging to separately image the two SBs in W51.
I'll see if that works...</p>
<p>Nope, the resulting error is much worse:</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The Sgr B2 ALMA data from project 2013.1.00269.S has imaging problems around
the brightest sources, especially Sgr B2 M.
Crystal Brogan &amp; Todd Hunter gave some useful advice, essentially the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the line forest is causing trouble, so line-containing regions of the spectrum
must be excluded when mapping</li>
<li>there is some nasty curvature in the spectral baseline that needs to be removed
probably by flagging out some of the data</li>
<li>Self-calibration is needed to exceed a dynamic range ~100</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Todd developed a <cite>fitcontinuum.py</cite> script to address the first point, but I ended up
doing this custom (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/SgrB2_ALMA_3mm_Mosaic/blob/master/script_12m/test_split_spw1.py">script</a>) because of the problem introduced by the second point.</p>
<p>To exclude the lines, I had to use <em>frequency-based</em> selection, not channel based, because my
spectral windows from different dates were offset by 10 MHz.  The approach to use in CASA is
ugly: you flag the line-containing data, then split (and in splitting, average) the continuum
into another MS.  From there, a phase-only selfcal is straigtforward (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/SgrB2_ALMA_3mm_Mosaic/blob/master/script_12m/selfcal_spw1_center.py">script</a>).</p>
