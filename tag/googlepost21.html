I wrote about half of this paper and did the majority of the work
described, including writing the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/bgpspipeline">data pipeline</a> and reducing all of
the data. However, there was a good deal of work done on the project
before I showed up on the scene.
The paper describes the methods by which we reduced the Bolocam
observations of the Northern Galactic Plane and the tests we ran to
determine how well we recovered the &quot;true&quot; sky structure.</p>

An interesting examination of the morphology of the circumstellar
material around IRAS 16594-4656. I did this work with Toshiya Ueta at
the University of Denver. My contribution was azimuthally interpolating
the 7 high-resolution long-slit spectra onto a 3-dimensional grid,
creating a full 3D position-velocity cube. I used <a class="reference external" href="http://pdl.perl.org/">the Perl Data
Language</a>, which I have since abandoned.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I've multiplied the 13CO integrated data cube, the Herschel 500
micron*, and the BGPS v1.0 and v2.0 by the appropriate conversion
factor to get the maps into units of column density assuming T=20K and
some opacity for the dust maps. BGPS v1 has been multiplied by the 1.5
&quot;correction&quot; factor.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Herschel maps are arbitrarily scaled; I didn't derive an actual
column conversion but just guess-and-checked once or twice until I got
something pretty close.</li>
</ul>

<p>The power spectra look pretty outstanding:</p>

<p>The bumps and wiggles in the 50-200&quot; range are quite well-matched in
Herschel and Bolocam. Some map edge effects are visible in the Herschel
maps, resulting in multi-frequency bumps at small spatial scales. The
Herschel noise floor is also quite evidently lower. Also noteworthy is
that BGPS v1 (scaled up by 1.5) matches the others &quot;pretty well&quot; but is
a worse match, in general, to the Herschel data than is the BGPS v2.
Here are some zoomed-in plots on the inverse scale:</p>

<p>And finally, the 13CO data is totally unrepresentative of the dust data.
There is very little agreement on any scale. This may imply that the
13CO and/or dust temperature is too high, as a decreased T_D or T_ex
will decrease 13CO column and increase dust column. However, it also
raises a question - on what scales should dust and CO agree?
This is getting into some real science, perhaps. The shapes of the CO
and dust power spectra disagree: the CO is pretty well-fit by a power
law, while the dust is not. What hypotheses can explain this?</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">There is a systematic temperature difference / preference in which CO
or dust is hotter on the largest scales.
-Dust is probably warmer on larger scales, however CO should be less
abundant / more readily dissociated on these largest, most diffuse
scales. CO shouldn't exist (or at least, should be underabundant) in
regions with high temperature. Maybe? This probably needs to be
quantified.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There is a systematic dust opacity difference on large scales
resulting in lower dust emission.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This is almost certainly true: the dust population increases in
opacity with age, following OH94. Dust on the largest spatial scales
should not have coagulated / collected ice, leading to a lower
opacity on the largest scales</li>
<li>This may also be true even though CO is present: dust coagulation
is less efficient than CO formation at n~10^3-10^4 (I think - again,
off the cuff, but consistent with OH94)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The CO overestimates all scales, either because of incorrect bulk
abundance or temperature considerations.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This is problematic..... if you drop the CO values at all scales, it
becomes deficient in the 50-200 arcsecond range, where the dust
measurements agree quite well</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There is a preferred distance in both images</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is not clear that the observed effects would occur because of
this</li>
<li>It is also quite evident from other analyses that there IS a
preferred velocity, at least, and it completely dominates all others
and has the same shape as the integrated power spectrum. So a
distance effect is most likely ruled out.</li>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>This is something of a repeat of yesterday's exercise, but for Herschel
data on larger scales, where filamentation is expected (at different
angles?) on a different scale than the Galactic plane.
First example: L030 500 microns</p>
<img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wtocYOxuJGo/Te6boI6cE7I/AAAAAAAAGNU/f9h0MXIPNh8/s320/bin_l30_plw_PSD.png" />

<p>There is evidently a preferred direction that is correlated down to the
resolution of the map, though the preference is smallest at the smallest
scales. This may simply be a statement that there are more sources along
the galactic plane, though, since there really isn't any particularly
obvious filamentation in the image.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LfWovOR8nBk/Te6bpM-PNTI/AAAAAAAAGNk/T9il85L34p0/s320/bin_l59_plw_PSD.png" />

<p>In L59, on the other hand, there is at most a very weak preference
except at the largest scales corresponding to the Galactic Plane. This
is somewhat interesting because there IS obvious filamentation in the
L59 image, but it does not have a preferred direction. Unfortunately, it
is not obvious whether or where filamentation shows up in fourier space
if it does not have a preferred direction. There is no excess at any
spatial scale that I can pick out.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>In our last group meeting, we discussed simulations using filamentary
structures. I've been trying to determine how best to generate
random/artificial filamentary structures in images. The first step in
that direction is coming up with a way to measure asymmetries and
therefore preferred directions within a real map. In order to do this,
I've had to develop a number of new tools in agpy for azimuthally binned
radial profiles and radially-averaged azimuthal profiles
(<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/agpy/source/browse/trunk/agpy/radialprofile.py">radialprofile.py</a>).
Examining real maps is necessary because a simple sinusoidal dependence
of the power introduces filamentation along the same directions at ALL
scales, which is not obviously (or in some cases, obviously not) the
correct solution. Filaments are observed on large scales, but sometimes
there can be 'kinks' in opposite directions on small scales.
So, the map I picked to examine was one with the most flagrantly obvious
filamentary structure in it: the Motte DR 21 MAMBO map. It was also a
choice of convenience because I already had the data on my laptop....</p>
<img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ULjqyt_ofEI/TexIAK9ohhI/AAAAAAAAGM0/eCEys_tFOTA/s320/MAMBOmap.png" />
<p>The preferred direction is quite obvious in this map: there is a long
filament going up and down the map. Therefore, the DC component should
be substantially higher in one direction than the other.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X7TY9wPUL7Y/TexIAZ7hH_I/AAAAAAAAGM8/IEkgX500_Os/s320/MAMBOpsd.png" />
<p>In the power-spectral-density image, it is quite clear that there is a
preferred direction, though it is not obvious that the fourier transform
is rotated 90 degrees from the image. My fourier intuition somewhat
fails me here.... I realize that a broad, smooth profile in real space
should be narrow and highly peaked in fourier space, but I don't fully
understand why it effectively spreads out in the perpendicular
direction, which I have confirmed that it does with a simple experiment.
I also don't know what the Shah function is, but it implies a periodic
dip in the image at every 1/5th of the image, or every 50 pixels.</p>

<p>These are the power spectra averaged over different angles as labeled.
-15 corresponds to -15 to +15, 15 corresponds to 15 to 45, etc. The
highly peaked 75-105 power spectrum shows the large-scale filamentary
profile. I think the difference in the DC component is actually an
artifact of the azimuthal binning process: each pixel can only be
assigned one angle, so the DC value isn't included in all of them...
I'll need to find a workaround for that because it's quite deceptive.</p>

<p>The more interesting way to view the data - and perhaps to analyze maps
- is to take <em>radial</em> averages in some range of spatial scales and plot
the azimuthal dependence. There is a clear sinusoid at large scales. The
legend shows &quot;spatial frequency&quot; in 1/pixel units. The distribution
becomes more even with angle and even changes preferred direction at
smaller scales (higher frequencies).
Next step is testing different approaches. I think an added,
steeper-power-law component would probably be the best way to start.
Another suggestion, courtesy Bruce Elmegreen, is to attempt this sort of
asymmetric power law sampling in 3 dimensions (with only 1 or 2
dimensions asymmetric) and then projecting down onto two dimensions.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>This is going to be a mishmash of various things....
First, Jared has run the same simulations I e-mailed out through the
V1.0 pipeline. Unfortunately, the results are not good - there is
substantial streaking of a variety not seen in the real data in V1.
Second, here are the simulated images from V2:

screwed up...</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>In the Experiment 7 simulations I was running, I observed greater noise
than expected, causing me to question the results of the <a class="reference external" href="http://bolocam.blogspot.com/2011/05/recovery-as-function-of-bolometer-noise.html">previous
post</a>. I therefore ran Experiment 8, which is the same as Experiment 6
from that post with a larger (320x320) map with a larger step size. The
noise recovery remains linear, but the scaling is quite different - a
factor of ~4 instead of ~12. The step size is the most likely culprit,
since an 8x larger step size should result in sqrt(8)~2.8 worse noise
per pixel.</p>

<p>There are some curious / worrisome artifacts that turn up and are
evident in the recovery fraction plot. For the low-noise cases, the
middle bolometers get totally flagged out because they are over-weighted
(by orders of magnitude).</p>
<img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0KKwo1wB6aI/TeAdFz6pTiI/AAAAAAAAGMg/yHGsx8j7WMM/s320/exp8_recovery_vs_bolonoiseRMS.png" />
<p>So I'm forced to explore via pyflagger. I will almost certainly need to
re-run all experiments after making a change to how weights are
computed.
Well, it turns out the problem is that those 28 bolos are scaled to
zero, even though there is nothing obvious (or even suggestive) in their
timestream plots. This is only true when varyrelscale is off. Apparently
varying the relative scales leads to a different problem.
AHA! The noise is so low that the relative scales are SO well correlated
that the signal is enough to cause problems! A plausible solution is
therefore no change to the pipeline, but to add minimal (nominal) noise
to the relative scales to increase the MAD so that the others don't get
flagged out.
So I added a 1% variation, which prevented flagging at the scale stage,
but there are still some disturbing artifacts in the map:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this problem requires further examination in detail. Exp
9/10 should probably be gaussians and airys on larger step-size maps,
but the solution will require something else, possibly even a change in
the pipeline. On the plus side, I think I can re-run experiment 7 with a
factor of 4 instead of 12 scaling for the noise and expect it to work.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>One clear simulation result comes from varying the amplitude of the
gaussian noise added to each bolometer's timestream for a fixed
atmosphere amplitude. The atmosphere amplitude sets the <em>mean</em> value of
the atmosphere timestream.
Increased bolometer noise results in decreased recovery of the outer
rings of the PSF. This is demonstrated in that the peak amplitudes
remain constant (as long as they are still recovered) while the aperture
sums (in 100&quot; radius apertures) decrease.
The simulations were run on a logarithmic spacing from 1e-3 to 1e0. The
1e0 point is missing because the peak flux wasn't recovered by the
gaussian fitter. The model maps don't recover the source at all for this
run, which is worrisome, since it means there is no iterative process
There is a minor concern that some simulations over-recover the peak at
high noise, but the effect is at a &lt;1% level so not very worrisome.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H0j13RdCays/Td6QrP78qWI/AAAAAAAAGMI/X-74WUEgYFE/s320/exp6_recovery_vs_bolonoiseRMS.png" />
<p>From the same set of simulations, I derive the pixel RMS of the map (the
noise level) derived from a give individual bolometer noise. The
theoretical expectation would be
Measured Noise = Input Noise / N(bolometers)
<em>if</em> the pixel sampling and the timestream sampling were the same (i.e.
there were exactly sqrt(nbolos) hits per pixel). This is not exactly the
case, and there are potential additional sources of noise. Nonetheless,
the naive theory appears to be good enough in this simulation:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ar8f4tdXUkQ/Td6fecs1WoI/AAAAAAAAGMQ/f_PwoxFp4Fo/s320/exp6_measurednoise_vs_bolonoiseRMS.png" />
<p>You can ignore the green/blue points in this plot; they just show that
the std. dev. around the source is dominated by the source.
Additionally, there is a noise floor, probably set by an inability to
model the point source when the S/N gets to be ~500, preventing
convergence of the iterator at a level better than 0.2%.
In short, though, I'm going to use 1/sqrt(nbolos) to determine the
appropriate input noise level in the astro simulations.</p>
