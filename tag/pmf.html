        </footer><!-- /.post-info -->
        <div class="entry-content"> <p>A few recent projects (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/W51_ALMA_2013.1.00308.S">ALMA W51</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/SgrB2_ALMA_3mm_Mosaic/">ALMA Sgr B2</a>) have raised
the question: How do we interpret unresolved millimeter sources?</p>
<p>In the two linked works, I concluded that most of the 1mm and 3mm point sources
we detected with ALMA at D&gt;5 kpc are protostars with dust envelopes - i.e.,
they are &quot;Class 0/I&quot;-like sources, but they are generally more luminous (and
therefore more massive) than their local analogs.</p>
<p>One of the appeals of the dust continuum, the wavelength range from about 0.5
to 2 mm, for studying star formation is that we usually assume that the source
brightness is proportional to the source mass.  For optically thin dust, this
assumption is pretty good.  The (systematic, unmeasurable) uncertainty is, to
first order, just the uncertainty in the dust temperature.</p>
<p>However, protostellar cores - dust cores that contain a YSO or any luminous
object (whether the luminosity is nuclear or gravitational in nature doesn't
matter) - violate those assumptions.  First, the dust is not isothermal, so the
emission is weighted toward the hotter dust that represents less of the total
mass.  Second, the dust is not necessarily optically thin - a centrally
concentrated source is likely to have a significant optical depth, particularly
at the shorter wavelengths.  Third, once the optically thin assumption is
broken, the source geometry matters; there may be some axes along which the
source is substantially brighter.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/observing/highest-priority-projects#flyout_2017.1.01355.L">ALMA-IMF program</a>,
which I am co-leading with Frederique Motte, Patricio Sanhueza, and Fabien Louvet, has the broad goal of
understanding the formation of the IMF in the Galaxy.  In practice, we will
measure some form of 1 mm luminosity function.  In the long term, we may be
able to obtain some additional constraints on the internal temperature
structures of the sources.  The imminence of this large data set motivates the
development of a general systematic analysis tool for assessing the
implications of the mm luminosity function on the underlying mass function.</p>
<p>In the related <a class="reference external" href="blog/protostellar-mass-functions.html">Protostellar Mass Functions</a> post, I implemented the
protostellar mass functions described by <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716..167M">McKee and Offner</a>.  These functions
provide the mapping between a stellar mass function and a protostellar mass
function given some assumed accretion history.  The assumed accretion histories
for the stars are very simple (in reality, accretion is probably quite
stochastic), but that's fine since it provides something testable.</p>
<p>I've then tried to follow up by implementing the next step toward producing
something comparable to observables as defined in <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...736...53O">Offner and McKee</a>, but
unfortunately this is a good deal more challenging.  We need a means to map a
protostellar mass to a luminosity, and there is no simple one-to-one function
to do this.</p>
<div class="section" id="protostellar-evolution-models">
<h2>Protostellar Evolution Models</h2>
<p>Several authors have described protostellar evolution models.  They mostly
refer back to <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...375..288P">Palla &amp; Stahler I</a> and <a class="reference external" href="Palla&amp;StahlerII">II</a>.  The <a class="reference external" href="Offner+2009">Offner
&amp; McKee model</a> is based on <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...603..383T">Tan &amp; McKee 2004</a>.  There is a
similar model by <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...691..823H">Hosokawa &amp; Omukai</a>, who have shown that high-mass stars can
have substantially varying structures (radii -&gt; luminosities) depending on
their accretion rates.  Mikhail Klassen implemented the <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...703..131O">Offner+ 2009</a>
protostellar evolution models <a class="reference external" href="MikhailKlassen">in fortran</a> in <a class="reference external" href="Klassen+2012">this paper</a>, with only slight differences assumed in the polytropic
parameters and the accretion luminosity (<a class="reference external" href="Offner+2009">Offner+</a> assumed 25%
of the accretion energy is lost to wind and treated the disk and star accretion
luminosity separately, according to <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.421.2861K">Klassen+ 2012</a>).</p>
<p>The Klassen implementation is the best immediately available to me.  Both they
and <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...736...53O">Offner and McKee</a> compared their results to <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...691..823H">Hosokawa &amp; Omukai</a>,
considering the latter to be more accurate, and found &quot;good&quot; agreement (&lt;2x
disagreement) in the radius as a function of mass.  The same comparison is
shown below; these figures match <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.421.2861K">Klassen+ 2012</a> Figures 1 and 2 (though I
don't plot exactly the same things).</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/Klassen_vs_Hosokawa_model_comparison.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>At least in priniple, these tools give us a mechanism to determine L(M, M_f),
the luminosity as a function of the current mass and the final mass of a star.
Alternatively, that can be written as L(t, M_f), the luminosity as a function
of time and final mass.  However, there is at least one major practical concern:
the protostellar evolution models have the free variable mdot, not M_f, so
in order to use these models, we need to populate a 'fully sampled' L(M, M_f) table.
Offner et al computed such a table, but then used an approximation for
R(M) - the stellar radius as a function of its mass - for their calculations.</p>
<!-- There are two types of accretion histories considered by Offner.  First, they -->
<!-- consider a series of constant (time-independent) accretion histories with mdot -->
<!-- determined by the final mass.  Second, they consider an accelerating -->
<!-- (time-dependent) accretion history.  Grids based on the former are easier to build; -->
<!-- grids based on the latter require modification of the Klassen code. -->
<p>Following Offner, though, the accretion histories are not constant.  Instead,
they use a variety of accretion histories: isothermal sphere, turbulent core,
and competitive accretion.
To compute the L(M, M_f) tables, we need to run a
modified version of the Klassen code with a variable accretion history.</p>
<p>The isothermal sphere case is actually a constant accretion rate, so that one is
pretty easy.  The turbulent core and competitive accretion models have an accretion
rate that depends on time or mass.</p>
<div class="section" id="turbulent-core-protostellar-evolution">
<h3>Turbulent Core Protostellar Evolution</h3>
<p>I've implemented the turbulent core accretion history in my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/protostellar_evolution">fork</a> of Mikhail
Klassen's repository.  The modification is fairly straightforward: the
accretion rate is set at each timestep according to Equation 23 of <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716..167M">McKee and
Offner</a> using the numerical constants they computed.  Then, if the stellar
mass has reached (or exceeds) the target stellar mass, set the accretion rate
to zero.  The stellar evolution code can then proceed with no further
accretion.</p>
<p>I've run this using the default initial conditions, a clump surface density
$Sigma_{cl} = 0.1$ g cm$^{-2}$.  The results are in the next figure: nearly
all of the interesting evolution happens before the stars reach 10 Msun.  The
accretion luminosity is almost always subdominant, at least once anything
reaches 10 Lsun.  The most massive star seems to shrink below its main sequence
size prior to reaching the main sequence, which is a little weird.  I'm not
sure if I trust that.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/Klassen_turbulentcore_model.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>Further exploration of accretion history parameter space is future work.
I now at least know how to set up the basic models and assemble lookup
tables for L(mf,t).</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="protostellar-sed-models">
<h2>Protostellar SED Models</h2>
<p>The next step in computing a millimeter luminosity distribution is to convert
from stellar luminosity to the reprocessed flux at a given wavelength.  This
step has an enormous number of free parameters, since the surrounding structure
may include both a disk and a core whose shapes will both vary.</p>
<p>There are two large grids of radiative transfer models that have been computed
for this purpose.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://zenodo.org/record/166732#.WdlXwmK3xcw">Robitaille grid</a> is complete and open, and it should
cover all stellar masses.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170808853Z">Zhang+ 2017</a> grid is not yet available, but it
may be more self-consistent.</p>
<p>I plan to use the protostellar evolutionary model parameters, i.e., the radius
and luminosity, to select models from this grid.  However, the Robitaille grid
uses surface temperature and radius, not luminosity and radius.  So we either
need to compute the stellar luminosity in the Robitaille models assuming the
stars are perfect blackbodies, then use the stellar luminosity to select from
that grid, or we need to compute the stellar surface temperature from
the evolutionary model.</p>
<p>Since the Robitaille models cover a large number of parameters, but do so in a
fairly sparse grid, it is not trivial to map from radius+luminosity to the
models.  For example, for a $2-3x10^5$ Lsun star with radius 40-50 Rsun,
there are 860 models in the <tt class="docutils literal">spubhmi</tt> grid, most of which lack flux measurements
in many apertures.</p>
<div class="section" id="example-model-selection">
<h3>Example Model Selection</h3>
<p>For this example, I'm looking at an mf=10 Msun star at t=0.58 Myr, at which
point it has m=6.5 Msun.  Its radius at this time is 9.0 Rsun and <em>stellar</em>
luminosity 1300 Lsun.  This is the line of output from the Klassen model:</p>

<p>My first attempt at this, with the <tt class="docutils literal">spubhmi</tt> model, resulted in one that has
no flux in small (4000 AU) aperture, which I don't yet know how to interpret -
it is certainly possible for such a source, with a non-negligible envelope, to
exist, and it would certainly produce some flux.</p>

<p>This one at least results in some hits.  There are three models with fluxes (at
Sgr B2, in a 2000 AU radius aperture, at 95 GHz) of 15-25, 155-170, and 55-60 mJy.
To build a model cluster, we would randomly select one of these models.
Robitaille notes, however, that some of the models are nonphysical; at the moment,
we have no way to assess that, so we have to do the selection blindly.  The brightest
model has a denser envelope and more massive disk.</p>
<p>We can use this to make a model cluster, but this is a pretty discouraging first model
given my previous work; this is presently a low-luminosity source that is surprisingly
intense at 3mm.</p>

This part is straightforward, at least.</p>
<p>Then, for each source, we 'rewind' to a specific time and select model parameters
from the protostellar evolution models described above.  The 'rewind' could be
from the point at which the stars reach &quot;stage 5&quot;, main sequence, or we could
select some other criteria.</p>
<p>Finally, we sample from the Robitaille parameters.  For this first example,
we just randomly select from some parameters that are within 5-10% of the target
parameters.  In the longer term, we'll want to be much more accurate
and find a way to interpolate the Robitaille models onto a &quot;fully sampled&quot; grid
of the parameter space we're interested in.  The Zhang models are probably
better to use once they become available since they may have accretion histories
consistent with those used for the evolutionary model.</p>

<h2>Final comments</h2>
<p>For the next post, I hope to actually generate some clusters and see what sorts
of uncertainties we're dealing with.  The above examples suggest they could be
truly extreme, and perhaps that the Robitaille models will be inadequate for
this purpose.  We'll see.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The stellar <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function">initial mass function</a> is important for a wide
variety of astronomical topics, and I'm interested in studying its formation.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716..167M">protostellar mass function</a>, by contrast, is much
less well-studied, but understanding it can provide important insights into the
formation of the IMF.  In particular, we assume both for simplicity and because
of a lack of contrary evidence, that the IMF is uniform in time in space.  In
other words, given that a star is going to form at some point, it has a
likelihood to become a star of a given mass described exclusively by the IMF.
While this assertion is entirely absurd - if you are &quot;about to form&quot; a star in
a blob of gas that only has 0.1 Msun in a 1 pc radius, it certainly cannot form
a 100 Msun star - it remains consistent with nearly all observations and is
therefore used in this time- and space-invariant form.</p>
<p>It is likely that new studies of stellar populations, e.g., GAIA's observations
of a huge population of stars with well-determined distances (and therefore
luminosities), will reveal some variations in the IMF.  However, many studies
based on evolved stellar populations are subject to ambiguities in the initial
conditions.  So, it is still quite useful to study those initial conditions
directly.</p>
<p>There has not been a huge amount of work on protostellar mass functions.
<a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716..167M">McKee and Offner</a> defined the PMF as the distribution of masses of
protostellar sources that would produce a given IMF.  Their PMFs are therefore
strongly dependent on the underlying IMF assumed.</p>
<p>I have implemented the mass functions they defined in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/imf/blob/master/imf/pmf.py">this code</a>.  The code
is generalized such that you can input other mass functions.  McKee &amp; Offner
only used the <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ASSL..327...41C">Chabrier 2005</a> mass function; I include the <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001MNRAS.322..231K">Kroupa 2001</a> mass
function as well for comparison</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/steadystate_pmf_chabrier_mmax3.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/steadystate_pmf_kroupa_mmax3.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The comparison between the Chabrier and Kroupa mass functions is shown above.
Note that these are somewhat deceptive plots, since they show P(M) vs log(M).
The plot shows the most likely individual masses by number, but the plots are
actually quite squished to the left in linear space, such that the most common
range of stars (the integral of both functions) is closer to the same (~0.2-0.3
Msun).  The more commonly shown version of these plots is the integral form,
which has a positive power-law slope in the lowest bin in the Kroupa MF,
showing the usual peak at 0.3 Msun.  This version of the functions is
nontrivial to compute, especially for the modified PMFs.</p>
<p>The mass-weighted versions of these may be more familiar, and they are more
similar to the P(log M) version used in <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716..167M">McKee and Offner</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ASSL..327...41C">Chabrier 2005</a>:</p>

<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/steadystate_pmf_kroupa_integral_mmax3.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The Chabrier version is a near-perfect match to Figure 3 of <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716..167M">McKee and
Offner</a>, with slightly different normalization (and I'm expressing P(M), not
P(log M); a previous version showed P(log M), but was incorrect).  A notable
feature of this plot is that it cuts off at 3 Msun.  I want to examine the same
distribution at higher masses.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/taperedaccretion_pmf_chabrier_mmax3.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/taperedaccretion_pmf_kroupa_mmax3.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The above plots are the same as before, but with tapered accretion following
the prescription in <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716..167M">McKee and Offner</a>.  The tapering function is apparently
arbitrary, and picked purely to enforce smoothness (i.e., prevent a possibly
nonphysical instantaneous shutoff of accretion).</p>
<div class="section" id="extending-to-higher-masses">
<h2>Extending to higher masses</h2>
<p>When we reevaluate the same functions with mmax=120 instead of 3, we can start
to see the high mass end, which is of course power-law dominated.   In all cases,
the PMF is dominated by the highest-mass sources, since in all cases they take
the longest to form.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/steadystate_pmf_chabrier_mmax120.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<img alt="" src="https://keflavich.github.io/blog/images/steadystate_pmf_kroupa_mmax120.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The accretion model changes the slope and the overall ratio of high- to
low-mass stars.</p>
<p>These are the mass fractions of various MFs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mass fraction for ChabrierIMF M&gt;10 = 0.192</li>
<li>Mass fraction for ChabrierPMF_2CTC M&gt;10 = 0.334</li>
<li>Mass fraction for ChabrierPMF_CA M&gt;10 = 0.150</li>
<li>Mass fraction for ChabrierPMF_IS M&gt;10 = 0.765</li>
<li>Mass fraction for ChabrierPMF_TC M&gt;10 = 0.288</li>
<li>Mass fraction for KroupaIMF M&gt;10 = 0.185</li>
<li>Mass fraction for KroupaPMF_2CTC M&gt;10 = 0.348</li>
<li>Mass fraction for KroupaPMF_CA M&gt;10 = 0.148</li>
<li>Mass fraction for KroupaPMF_IS M&gt;10 = 0.781</li>
<li>Mass fraction for KroupaPMF_TC M&gt;10 = 0.294</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The isothermal sphere case is pretty extremely top-heavy, but all except
competitive accretion result in a more top-heavy MF, which is a fairly neat
result - it means that simple binning can distinguish between these theories
(assuming the parametrization is right).  It also means that the SFRs
inferred from integrating the high-mass end of the mass function (as I have
done in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/keflavich/SgrB2_ALMA_3mm_Mosaic/">my Sgr B2 paper</a>) is subject to a factor of +/-2x uncertainty
depending on the accretion history if we assume steady state.</p>
<p>The next step is to extend this to different accretion histories (tapered,
accelerating) and then possibly different star formation histories.
I will also create some 'synthetic clusters' using the <a class="reference external" href="https://zenodo.org/record/166732">Robitaille</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08853">Zhang</a> models.</p>
