</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><p>I attempted to use TripleSpec finder / guider images to search for
variability &nbsp;on short (~5s) timescales in the Orion Nebula region. &nbsp;This
project was an offshoot of the related
<a class="reference external" href="http://adamginsburg.blogspot.com/2012/10/using-guider-images-to-achieve.html">http://adamginsburg.blogspot.com/2012/10/using-guider-images-to-achieve.html</a>.
&nbsp;I successfully matched the images using a particular catalog &amp; the
ever-cool&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://astrometry.net/">astrometry.net</a>with a great deal of assistance from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dstn/">Dustin Lang</a>&nbsp;and some from <a class="reference external" href="http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/2012/10/time-for-astrometrynet-to-rise-again.html">David Hogg</a>. &nbsp;I'll post details of that
process later; it proved challenging but will DEFINITELY be useful again
in the future. &nbsp;Short story: I had to build my own indices, then fit
twice - once for the first match, once after distortion was applied to
re-extract the sources in the right location.
Conveniently, one of the products output by the astrometry.net code is
ra,dec locations and fluxes (background subtracted) for all of the
identified sources. &nbsp;So, I used a simple script to match all sources
within 2&quot; of a known source from my input catalog and generate
timestream data. &nbsp;It took about an hour of processing (nested for loops
- awful, but the only obvious choice at first. &nbsp;Half of the time was
probably file IO anyway).
I now had a few hundred timestreams of Orion stars. &nbsp;At this point, I
hadn't done any kind of quality control, which was obviously a problem
because the Trapezium and neighbors were clearly saturated. &nbsp;Also, there
are known hot pixels that will drive some stars into weird behavior.
&nbsp;But I ignored all of that. &nbsp;All I did for quality control was reject
stars with more than about 5% missing data.
I elected to go straight for PCA analysis. &nbsp;I assumed the primary
component (the most correlated component) would be from the atmosphere,
which is almost certainly true. &nbsp;Subtracting that off (shown in the
notebook linked below) left some clearly correlated components left over
- some of these are instrumental, others are correlated backgrounds,
others are correlated saturation levels. &nbsp;I don't honestly know what all
of the components are, but I DO know that correlated components are very
unlikely to be intrinsic phenomena - stellar brightness isn't
correlated.
So I tried to cut out ALL correlated components. &nbsp;However, I think in
the process I probably removed any useful information - even
un-correlated signal should probably have a high amplitude (if it's
interesting...) that will get removed through the process I used.
&nbsp;Nonetheless, I probably have some upper limits on the 5s scale
variability of these stars in K-band. &nbsp;Not enough to do anything like
asteroseismology, but it was worth a day's effort.
Here's the ipython notebook (gist &amp; nbviewer) for those interested:
